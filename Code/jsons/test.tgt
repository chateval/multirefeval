_go sounds good ! let 's see , i want . _eos
_go yeah ? _eos
_go i want you to put your hands behind your head ! you are under arrest ! _eos
_go what for ? _eos
_go they want the government to reduce the price of the gasoline . _eos
_go it is really a hot potato . _eos
_go that 's excellent . how have you managed that ? _eos
_go mainly because we 've invested in a heat recovery system . _eos
_go what does that mean exactly ? _eos
_go well , we use the exhaust gases from our printing presses to provide energy to heat our dryers . _eos
_go what other sources of energy do you use ? _eos
_go we do n't use any fossil fuels . most of our power comes from hydro - electric plants . we 're hoping to use even more energy from alternative sources in the future - perhaps even wind power . _eos
_go well , people from asia to europe all enjoy tea . _eos
_go right . and china is the homeland of tea . _eos
_go yes , chinese people love drinking tea so much . some even claim they ca n't live without tea . _eos

_go i 'm afraid i 'm a poor talker . i 'm not comfortable talking with the people whom i have just met for the first time . that is not very good for business , so i have been studying public speaking . _eos
_go are you more of a leader or a follower ? _eos
_go i do n't try to lead people . i 'd rather cooperate with everybody , and get the job done by working together . _eos
_go do you think you can make yourself easily understood in english ? _eos
_go yes , in most circumstances . _eos
_go are you available for travel ? _eos
_go yes , i like travelling . i am young , and unmarried . it 's no problem for me to travel frequently . _eos
_go i think it 's a distance of 180 kilometers from here to london , so it should be a two - hour drive on the motorway . _eos
_go that 's unless there is a traffic jam . it could take three hours . _eos
_go you 're right . we will be able to travel at high speeds at the beginning and end of the journey , because we will be in built - up areas . _eos
_go so , shall we allow three hours to cover the distance ? _eos
_go ok . you have n't seen my company car , have you ? _eos
_go no . let me take a look ... it 's longer than my car . _eos
_go i think it 's over five meters long . i ca n't remember exactly . it has a maximum speed of over 200 kilometers an hour . _eos
_go wow ! that 's fast ! i do n't think we will be traveling that fast on the motorway . _eos
_go we ca n't . if we went that fast , we would break the speed limit . _eos
_go do you want the truth ? _eos
_go of course , i do . _eos
_go well , you really did n't do all that well . _eos
_go how bad did i do ? _eos
_go to be completely honest , you failed your test . _eos
_go how ? _eos
_go there were a number of reasons . _eos
_go what were they ? _eos
_go basically , you just ca n't drive . _eos
_go can i have another try ? _eos

_go do n't worry , young man . lat me give you an examination . first let me take a look at your throat . open your mouth and say'ah ' . _eos
_go ah . _eos
_go your throat is inflamed . and your tongue is heavily coated . you have all the symptoms of influenza . _eos

_go i ran a red light ? _eos
_go yes , you did . _eos
_go i apologize , but i did n't realize that i did . _eos
_go were n't you taught that yellow means slow down , not speed up ? _eos
_go i did learn that . _eos
_go so , then why did you speed up ? _eos
_go i do n't know what to tell you . _eos

_go i try my best to eat only fruits , vegetables , and chicken . _eos
_go is that really all that you eat ? _eos
_go that 's basically it . _eos
_go how do you stick to only those foods ? _eos
_go actually , fruits and veggies are really good for you . _eos
_go yeah , i know , but what about the chicken ? _eos
_go i mainly eat baked chicken , because there 's not a lot of fat . _eos
_go that does sound pretty good . _eos
_go i know it does , and that 's because it is . _eos
_go could you show me where the chinesc - style clothing is located ? i want to buy a silk coat . _eos
_go this way , please . here they are . they 're all handmade . _eos
_go oh , they look nice . may i try that black one on ? _eos

_go let 's take a look at the menu so we can order . do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share ? _eos
_go what would you rather have , samosas or poppadoms ? _eos
_go i heard that one of their specialities is the samosa . _eos
_go well , let 's get a plate of those then . _eos
_go sounds good . what are you going to have for your main course ? _eos
_go i think i might have a dahl . _eos
_go what 's in a dahl ? _eos
_go it 's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice . _eos
_go that sounds nice . do you want to share some kebabs as well ? _eos
_go ok . how about some lamb kebabs ? _eos
_go that 's my favourite . do you want to have some wine or beer ? _eos
_go i think i 'll have a beer . _eos
_go ok , shall i flag down the waitress ? _eos
_go i would n't recommend it . i think we should wait until she comes round . _eos
_go you 're right . that might seem a bit rude . it 's a good thing i 've got you with me ! _eos
_go what would you do without me ? _eos
_go of course . i 've loved writing since i was a very little boy . i won the first prize in a national composition contest when i was in middle school . after attending nanjing university , i never give up writing . my works , such as father 's tobacco pipe , open air cinema , the old city were respectively published china youth daily , yangzi evening news , and new beijing . during the period of studying for my degrees of master and doctor , i paid more attention to developing my research ability and published several papers . the impact of internet in chinese political participation , the discipline of remold , the historical direction of chinese administration reform , bribery cases of self governance in chinese villages are respectively published in chinese publish administration , beijing due xuebao , theory and society and chinese reform . i joined in yangzi evening news to work as a part - time journalist in 2006 . during this period , i 've written a lot of comments , which improved my writing ability to a new level , i have full confidence in my writing ability , and i believe i can do the job well . _eos
_go yes , i 'd like to reserve a table for dinner . _eos
_go how large a group are you expecting ? _eos
_go six couples . _eos
_go would you like to reserve a private dining room ? _eos
_go that sounds like a good idea . _eos
_go all right . may i have your name , sir ? _eos
_go my name is ron kollwitz . _eos
_go it 's nice to meet you , mr . cooper . _eos
_go nice to meet you , ms . wang . you must be exhausted after your long trip from canada . _eos
_go yes , it was quite a long flight . i 'm glad to finally be here . _eos
_go no , but i 'll be able to tomorrow . _eos
_go that 'll be too late . _eos
_go why do n't you ask bill if he can help ? _eos
_go i did , but he was n't able to either . _eos
_go yes , i have been working in the public relations section of a company in the past two years . i plan the advertising campaign and cooperate the work of artists and typographers . sometimes i have to do the work of a specialist when there 's something urgent . _eos
_go do you have any practical experience as a secretary ? _eos
_go yes , sir . i acted as a secretary in an insurance company . _eos
_go would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ? _eos
_go well , to begin with , i would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average . _eos
_go have you had any experience with computer ? _eos
_go yes , i studied in a computer training program , and can process data through the computer . _eos
_go that 's fine . what about operating the fax and duplicator ? _eos
_go i can handle them without any trouble _eos
_go what have you learned from jobs you have held ? _eos
_go above all , i have learned that what is good for the company is good for me . so i follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed . _eos
_go very good . _eos
_go where have you been ? i 've been trying to get in touch with you for two days . _eos
_go i went to salt lake city on business . what 's up ? _eos
_go i got fired . _eos
_go how come ? last time i saw you . you told me it was a good job , and you 'd like to take it as a career . that was only one month ago . why this sudden change ? _eos
_go it 's a long story . in a word , i did n't do a good job of it . i messed up a business deal , a deal that would have made ten million dollars and i messed it up . _eos
_go what are you going to do now ? _eos
_go i am trying to find a job asap . lily does n't know yet . i did n't tell her . i spent the past three days at the coffee shop next to your office , and she thought i went to work as usual . _eos
_go that 's not the way to solve the problem . did you look in the classified advertisements column ? _eos
_go yes , i did . but i was n't qualified for most of the jobs that i was interested in . _eos
_go listen . i will see what i can do , ok ? you go home and tell lily about this problem you have now . she is your wife and i am sure she will understand . _eos
_go i just do n't know how to bring it up . well , all right . she has the right to know anyways . _eos
_go i 've never gotten one . have you ? _eos
_go i got a ticket yesterday . _eos
_go really ? what did you get one for ? _eos
_go i parked in the red zone . _eos
_go why did you do that ? _eos
_go i needed to get something really quick . _eos
_go where did you park at ? _eos
_go at my apartment building . _eos
_go do n't you have your own parking spot ? _eos
_go i needed to be fast . _eos
_go that was very lazy of you . _eos
_go i 'm having a problem . _eos
_go what problem are you having ? _eos
_go there have been charges made on my debit card that i did n't make . _eos
_go do you have the statement for your card ? _eos
_go here it is . _eos
_go what are the charges you 're referring to ? _eos
_go the last four charges on the page . _eos
_go i 'm afraid we 're going to have to investigate these charges . _eos
_go how long will an investigation take ? _eos
_go i honestly do n't know , but we will freeze payment on these charges . _eos
_go that sounds absolutely fantastic . _eos
_go i do n't know . can i purchase treasury certificates here at this counter ? _eos
_go yes , of course . we have treasury notes with two , three and five - year terms available . _eos
_go two years is fine , with a value of 1,000 rib . _eos
_go ok , could i take a look at some i d please , like a passport ? _eos
_go here you go . by the way , is it possible to cash them before the maturity comes up ? _eos
_go no , i 'm afraid that is n't possible . you must wait until maturity before you cash them . _eos
_go i am not cheating . when you pass go , you collect $ 200 , everyone knows that ! _eos
_go well you ca n't just take the money . you have to ask the bank for money . and i 'm the banker . _eos
_go banker ? _eos
_go yes ... _eos
_go can i have my $ 200 please ? _eos
_go sure . here you are , $ 200 , thank you , please come again ! now it 's my turn to roll the dice . _eos
_go this is professor clark speaking . _eos
_go hi , this is kalina from your morning literature class . _eos
_go yes , what can i do for you ? _eos
_go i had a skydiving accident over the weekend and wo n't be able to come to school today . _eos
_go my goodness ! are you ok ? _eos
_go i broke my leg , but it is healing . _eos
_go how long will you be out of class ? _eos
_go i should be able to return by next monday . _eos
_go fine . well , thanks for calling and letting me know you will be absent . i hope you feel better soon . _eos
_go yes , yes i did . please come in ! i 'm so glad you came ! this old house is falling apart ! come on into the bathroom . see , here , there 's water leaking everywhere ! _eos
_go i see . let me have a look . it seems that your toilet is clogged , and that 's why it wo n't flush . let me just get my plunger . no , that 's not working either . i suspect that there 's some sort of foreign object in the pipes that 's causing a blockage . that 's what 's making your toilet overflow . _eos
_go oh , that must be because of my four - year - old daughter . she is always flushing things down the toilet . you know how kids are . _eos
_go yeah , i have a little one myself . anyway , these water pipes are really rusty , so they also should be changed . thatcould be causing water to not drain completely , that might lead to more problems in the future . i would also suggest fixing this faucet that is n't shutting off properly . i could have it all finished by today if it 's urgent . _eos
_go that would be great ! is it expensive ? _eos
_go let 's see ... i would say about eight hundred dollars . _eos
_go i 'm glad to help you . what 's wrong ? _eos
_go my mother - in - law just went into the hospital in l . a . hank and i will be flying there tonight . _eos
_go i 'm sorry to hear it . what 's wrong with her ? _eos
_go doctors are n't sure yet . but the real problem is suzy . she has a bad cold , and we do n't want to take her with us . but we do n't know who can stay with her . _eos
_go you need a babysitter . _eos
_go yes , i 'd ask jill , the girl i 've had before , but i need someone overnight . maybe even for two nights . _eos
_go i could have suzy stay at my place . _eos
_go i do n't want to do that to you , karen . _eos
_go why not ? _eos
_go your own kids would get suzy 's cold . i think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . but i do n't know who to ask . i need someone more mature than jill . it might even be for two or three days . _eos
_go i know who we can ask . there is a girl i know , sara ralston . she is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . i know her from my church , and i trust her completely . _eos
_go i 'd like to talk with her . this is short notice , i know . but hank and i are leaving tonight . _eos
_go i 'll get you her number . i hope she can do it . she is very responsible . _eos
_go i 'm glad you know someone . i knew you would be the best person to ask about this . i do n't want to insult jill or her mother . i think jill maybe could do it . but i 'd rather have someone a little older . _eos
_go i 'll go home and get sara 's number . i 'll call her first myself . _eos
_go great . then call me and let me know if she 's free . _eos
_go i 'd like a beer . what kind of beer do you have ? _eos
_go draft beer and cans beer . which do you prefer ? _eos
_go a draft beer please . _eos
_go ok . here you are . _eos
_go could i have some fruit ? _eos
_go of course . wait for a moment , please . _eos
_go fine , thank you , and how are you ? _eos
_go very well , thank you . it 's nice to meet you again . i am awfully sorry for not being able to meet you at the airport , as i was busy yesterday . i do hope you had a very enjoyable trip from new york . _eos
_go yes , a very pleasant journey indeed . thank you . _eos
_go how are you getting along with your business ? _eos
_go not bad . the fur market is not very brisk lately , but the selling season is advancing near . i hope there will be more buyers in the market this year . _eos
_go i hope we can do more business together . though we are satisfied with our past trade record , there are still possibilities for more business . in the meantime , let 's discuss other spheres of cooperation , such as investment , technology transfer and technical assistance . _eos
_go toilets are in the rear , i am afraid all the toilets are fully occupied at the moment . _eos
_go what ? oh , what we live ! thank you very much for your help , miss . _eos
_go you are welcome . _eos
_go you can buy the bubble wrap here , but you 'll have to stand in line over here to post your passage . _eos
_go that 's a really long line . how long do you think it 'll take to get through all those people ? _eos
_go it takes about 3 minutes per person , so it 'll probably be about an hour 's wait . _eos
_go can i buy stamps here ? _eos
_go sure . how many would you like ? _eos
_go i need 30 for my christmas cards . _eos
_go are you sending them abroad ? _eos
_go twenty of them are going abroad to china and america . _eos
_go do you have any going anywhere in the eu ? if you do , those are less expensive . _eos
_go no . _eos
_go ok , here you go . that will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence . _eos
_go and the bubble wrap ? _eos
_go that 's another quid . _eos

_go are you good at cooking ? _eos
_go i have studied its skills recently at a training school . i plan to run a restaurant , so i have to practise cooking ! _eos
_go it is a good idea . what dish are you cooking now ? ! _eos
_go i am steaming fish in a pressure cooker . have you ever tried steamed fish ? _eos
_go yes , i have . but the taste of steamed fish at that restaurant is not delicious . the fish is not well - done and too salty . _eos
_go that 's the case . i think there is not enough time to steam it and soy sauce is too much . _eos
_go i have the same idea as yours . _eos
_go it 's ok . please have a taste of it . _eos
_go thank you . oh , it 's very delicious . _eos
_go thank you for your praise . _eos
_go besides steamed fish , what else are you good at cooking ? _eos
_go i am good at stewing beef with potato , frying chicken , hot and sour soup etc . _eos
_go so many dishes . next friday week is my birthday . i would like to invite you to cook for my dinner party , ok ? _eos
_go why not ? it is a good opportunity for me to practise cooking . _eos
_go thanks a lot . _eos

_go that 's fine . _eos

_go it can be solved by drawing a draft on us at 90 days sight . _eos
_go what about a draft at 120 days sight ? _eos
_go all right . but we demand the draft be accepted by a bank acceptable to us . _eos
_go a bank 's acceptance will add to the costs of our imports . you can rest assured that we will accept the draft and honour it when it comes due . _eos
_go then we will be in a position to arrange for a loan from our bank . you know we exports would like to have our investments returned as early as possible . _eos
_go i hope this transaction will pave the way for further business relations between our two countries . _eos
_go so do i . _eos

_go that 's nice , but tell me what she looks like . _eos
_go the first thing i noticed was her beautiful brown eyes . _eos
_go i think i might 've bumped into her before . _eos
_go are you telling me that you 've seen her before ? _eos
_go i believe so . _eos
_go yes , and i want to buy the insurance too . i think it 's necessary . _eos
_go you 're smart to buy it . at 45 dollars for three days , it is a good deal . _eos
_go can i return the car in san francisco ? _eos
_go san francisco ? no , sir . we only have this office here . you will have to return it here . _eos
_go really ? i heard in america you can return rental cars in different cities . _eos
_go no , sir . that 's only with the very big companies . i 'm sorry , but this car must be returned to this lot . _eos
_go well , i guess i will have to drive back down then . hmm . i did n't think of that . _eos
_go do you still want the car , sir ? _eos
_go yes . it will be fun . driving back down the coast . my girlfriend will like it . _eos
_go it 's a beautiful drive . _eos
_go where are the keys ? _eos
_go just a moment , sir . we have to finish filling out the forms . _eos

_go speaking of seafood , my mouth is watering . let 's go to the seafood restaurant in our neighborhood . _eos
_go sound great . let 's go ! _eos

_go you sound like a seafood expert . i would like to have some stir - fried squids and steamed shrimps . _eos
_go you are not too bad as well . i also want to have a steamed lobster . it is really taste like heaven . _eos
_go let 's go into the restaurant and find a table to order some food . _eos

_go i 'm going to the hospital . _eos
_go get in . i 'll take you . _eos

_go it will cost you $ 10 . _eos

_go it 's a quarter to 12 . could you please drive a little faster ? _eos
_go certainly . _eos
_go where was it from ? _eos
_go it was made in jingdezhen . _eos
_go jingdezhen ? is n't it called'the capital of porcelain ' ? _eos
_go you are right . _eos
_go this is the very thing i 've been dreaming of . _eos
_go it is the best quality porcelain - the famous egg - shell china . _eos
_go it must be most precious . _eos
_go but it is really worth the price . _eos
_go hello , i am going to the store to buy some fruit . _eos
_go oh , would you do me a favor ? _eos
_go yes ? _eos
_go please mail this letter for me on your way to the store . _eos
_go sure . do you want it to be registered ? _eos
_go yes , i think so . there are some pictures in it . it would be a great pity if they were lost . _eos
_go yes , i will be glad to mail your letter . _eos
_go thanks . _eos
_go you are welcome . _eos
_go alright . _eos
_go it does n't work . it looks like it 's broken . i need to get to a hospital . you should drive me there . _eos
_go oh , yeah ? it 's better if we make a police report first . then you can go to the hospital . _eos
_go damn it ! i 'm injured here . we could wait all day for the police . _eos
_go well , you 'll just have to wait . i 'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . i 'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . do n't worry . you 'll get to the hospital in time . _eos
_go it really hurts . _eos
_go yes , maybe it does . but if you 're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . you know what i mean ? _eos
_go to hell with you . the accident was your fault . _eos
_go i 'm afraid it was n't . and when the police get here , you will also see that it was n't . but enough of this bickering . i 'm going to go find a phone . do n't move that arm while i 'm gone . alright ? _eos
_go to hell with you . _eos
_go hello . i 'm thinking about watching a chinese traditional opera with a foreign girl . what 's on this weekend ? _eos
_go well , there will be charity performance on saturday night . and also , there will be a solo concert by an opera star on sunday night . _eos
_go it 's a good thing that i have choices here . can you tell me about the one on saturday ? _eos
_go sure . it 's to raise money for the homeless . _eos
_go what about the performance itself ? _eos
_go oh , it 's a reserved opera named the monkey creates havoc in heaven . _eos
_go wow , a story about the clever monkey king . it 's a classic and children 's favorite . _eos
_go it surely is . and the cast is really the best . _eos
_go wonderful ! how much is the ticket ? _eos
_go the price varies according to the seats . 300 for the front , 200 for the middle , and 50 for the back . _eos
_go well , we could probably get started with a preparatory meeting this afternoon at 2:00 . _eos
_go i tell you what , 2:00 is not available for me , but you can get started and i 'll come by at around 3:00 _eos
_go that 's fine with me . how much time are we going to have to work on this ? _eos
_go perhaps one year , i 'm not sure . _eos
_go french dressing , please . _eos
_go i beg your pardon ? _eos
_go oh , french dressing . _eos
_go sorry , it 's not available now . anything else ? _eos
_go we still prefer french dressing . _eos
_go certainly . and what vegetables would you like ? _eos
_go oh , spinach , i think . _eos
_go fine , and what about something to drink ? _eos
_go just a beer , please . _eos
_go good . thank you . sir . _eos
_go would you like to have some more beer ? _eos
_go no , thanks . i 've had enough . i 'll have my bill , please . _eos
_go of course . please wait a moment . i 'll go and get it . _eos
_go thank you . _eos
_go sure . first of all , it 's very important for you not to be late . job interviewers usually do n't think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . _eos
_go yeah , that 's very important . _eos
_go so you 'd better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . so the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . _eos
_go i 'll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . _eos
_go that 's right . you need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . _eos
_go it 's always easier to say something than to do it . _eos
_go it 's not too difficult to make a good impression . for example , you should take care to appear well - groomed and modestly dressed . avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . this will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . _eos
_go but i love wearing t - shirts and jeans . _eos
_go i advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . _eos
_go it 's a pity that i can not afford more expensive clothes . _eos
_go you misunderstood me . clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . _eos
_go i know what you mean . i ought to wear right clothes at the right time . _eos
_go you got it . only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . _eos
_go it seems that'clothes make the man ' . _eos
_go it may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior . _eos
_go no idea . your guess is as good as mine . _eos
_go it better be more than last year . _eos
_go well , anything is better than nothing . wait and see . _eos
_go what a pity ! _eos
_go if you do n't mind , may we put it off to the next day ? _eos
_go that 's ok . _eos
_go hello . i need to find out if a receipt of proceeds has arrived . i 'm from felix wasserman associates . _eos
_go thanks . have you got the l / c number ? _eos
_go it 's nx567822100007 . _eos
_go hang on a tick and i 'll check for you . i 'm sorry ; we have no record of that arriving . _eos
_go ok , thanks for checking . could you give me a ring when it arrives , please ? _eos
_go no problem . i 'll be in touch as soon as it comes in . _eos
_go yes . i have to stay in your cry for just one day , can you suggest a short tour ? _eos
_go are you interested in the natural landscape or the human landscape ? _eos
_go i would prefer the first one . _eos
_go sure . we have a one - day trip along the river . it 's quite beautiful . _eos
_go i need to find out some more information for l / c . i would like an outline of responsibilities , both ours , yours and the beneficiary , please . _eos
_go ok , to start , the conditions are specified by the buyer and may include insurance forms , way bills , bills of lading , customs forms , various certificates . _eos
_go ok , got it . is there anything else i need to know before we go ahead ? _eos
_go just that in effect , a basic letter of credit is a financial contract between the bank , the bank 's customer , and the beneficiary , and this contract involves the transfer of goods or services against funds . _eos
_go that sounds fine , thanks for that . let 's go ahead ! _eos
_go i would like to report a break - in . _eos
_go when was this break - in ? _eos
_go i believe it happened last night . _eos
_go where was the break - in ? _eos
_go it happened at my house . _eos
_go was anything stolen ? _eos
_go i have n't checked yet . _eos
_go why do you think there was a break - in ? _eos
_go my front window was broken . _eos
_go we 'll send a squad car shortly . _eos
_go i 'd appreciate that . _eos
_go one dollar . _eos
_go so , i can have five for five dollars ? _eos
_go actually , you can only have four . _eos
_go oh , yeah . i forgot tax . give me four then , please . _eos
_go okay . thanks . _eos
_go come in please . _eos
_go good evening , sir . i come to make the bed . shall i do it now or later ? _eos
_go well , since you have come , do it now please ? _eos
_go that 's all . have a nice stay here . _eos
_go thank you . please get some soap for us . _eos
_go just a moment . i will do it right now . _eos
_go oh ? what 's wrong ? _eos
_go my daughter 's just banged up her knee pretty badly and i 'm going to have to take her to the hospital . i 'll be about two hours late . _eos
_go yes , come in please . i am mr . li . you must be my liu , right ? _eos
_go yes , i am my liu . thanks . _eos
_go i 'd like to start this interview with some questions . why do you think you are qualified for this position ? _eos
_go according to your advertisement , you want an experienced software engineer . i think my background meets the requirement of this position . _eos
_go then tell me something about your background . _eos
_go my major was computer science when i was at college , and i am quite familiar with visual c + + and java language . _eos
_go well , what do you think about the development in computers ? _eos
_go the developments in software are going ahead very quickly and more and more problems are resolved by software . in some regions , the hardware is completely replaced by software . so i think the software industry has a great future . _eos
_go have you ever designed any programs concerning network ? _eos
_go yes , i have designed some programs for the network with visual c + + and i have passed the test for programmers - muse . _eos
_go have you got anything to ask me ? _eos
_go yes , can you tell me what 's my responsibility in this position ? _eos
_go yes , of course . you would be responsible for the development of software products . _eos
_go i see . this is my advantage . _eos
_go good . have you got any other questions ? _eos
_go no . _eos
_go ok , i will contact you in a week . see you . _eos
_go thank you , bye - bye . _eos
_go can you take he away from me ? _eos
_go i 'm just coming for that . _eos
_go she kept bothering me . _eos
_go she 's your sister . what she asked was only duck soup for you . why ca n't you be good to her ? _eos
_go but i am her brother , not her servant . _eos
_go maybe you should look around for an outlet . _eos
_go that is a wonderful idea . _eos
_go outlets have more reasonable prices . _eos
_go thank you for your help . _eos
_go no problem . good luck _eos
_go the apples are 30nt each . how many would you like ? _eos
_go let 's see , 30nt is about ... almost a dollar us . what ? ! how about these pineapples ? _eos
_go they 're 250nt each , but they 're not edible . they 're only used for worship . _eos
_go hmm , 250nt is ... 8 dollars ? ! ! and you ca n't even eat them ? you 're crazy ! _eos
_go wait ! do n't go just yet . these bananas are pretty cheap -- only 35nt for this bunch . _eos
_go now that 's more like it ! bananas have lots of potassium , too ! _eos
_go they 're also good for your digestion ! would you like some kiwis , too ? _eos
_go are they from taiwan ? _eos
_go they 're imported from new zealand . four for 50nt . nine for a hundred . _eos
_go ok . i 'll take four kiwis . _eos
_go sure . what do you need ? _eos
_go well , i wanted to let you know that i 've put in my notice . _eos
_go really ? why ? _eos
_go it 's complicated . but basically it boils down to one thing . this company is downsizing and i ca n't continue working for a company that may let me go . _eos
_go but surely they wo n't fire you ! you 're one of the most experienced managers here ! _eos
_go well , to be honest , there 's another reason . i 've got a better offer . _eos
_go well that 's great news ! congratulations ! where will you be located ? _eos
_go the head office is in new york , but i 'll be dealing with overseas companies and flying to this side of the world from time to time . _eos
_go it 'll be sad to see you go , but it sounds like you 're found yourself a great opportunity . _eos
_go i have . i feel lucky . i look forward to dealing with overseas companies and at the same time having a chance to use english more . _eos
_go i 'm sorry to bring this up , but would it be possible for you to write me a letter of recommendation before you go ? _eos

_go alright . there are several models you may want to look at . this kreng portable cassette player is very good . _eos
_go kreng ? i 've never heard of that company . _eos
_go it 's a german company . this unit has auto - reverse , recording capability , and an am / fm radio band . it also has a built - in microphone . _eos
_go i suppose i do n't want that one then . i do n't like auto - reverse . it breaks too easily . _eos
_go really ? have you had an auto - reverse break before ? _eos
_go yes , twice now . i think it 's too high - tech , and so it 's the first part that breaks . _eos
_go hmm . you know , the problem might be dust . did you clean the unit often ? _eos
_go well . no , i did n't clean it . but still , i only had the last one two months , and it broke . i do n't trust auto - reverse . _eos
_go alright . well . we have many units without auto - reverse . here is a good unit . very reliable . it has an am / fm band , built - in microphone , recording capability , and no auto - reverse . _eos
_go how much is it ? _eos
_go this one sells for $ 39 . 99 . _eos
_go can i test it out ? _eos
_go of course . _eos
_go it sounds great . i 'll take it . _eos

_go what type of position are you looking for ? _eos
_go i 'm looking for a position in which i can utilize my experience . _eos
_go are you interested in a full - time or part - time position ? _eos
_go i am more interested in a full - time position . however , i would also consider a part - time position . _eos
_go can you tell me about your responsibilities at your last job ? _eos
_go i advised customers on financial matters . after i consulted the customer , i completed a customer inquiry form and catalogued the information in our database . i then collaborated with colleagues to prepare the best possible package for the client . the clients were then presented with a summarized report on their financial activities that i formulated on a quarterly basis . _eos
_go what is your greatest strength ? _eos
_go i am an excellent communicator . people trust me and come to me for advice . one afternoon , my colleague was involved with a troublesome customer who felt he was not being served well . i made the customer a cup of coffee and invited both my colleague and the client to my desk where we solved the problem together . _eos
_go what is your greatest weakness ? _eos
_go i tend to spend too much time making sure the customer is satisfied . however , i began setting time - limits for myself . _eos
_go why do you want to work for our company ? _eos

_go immediately . _eos
_go well , all right . there are four points you should keep in mind when you file documents , information and other things . _eos
_go what are they ? _eos
_go they are keep the documents in chronological order , remove all the chips and pins , punch the documents evenly and place them in the folder . _eos
_go and what is the most important point ? _eos

_go yes , they were . but it has already past . the traffic from the airport to downtown has been relieved after the completion of yan'an aerial road . _eos
_go we 've never expected that shanghai is such a big metropolis , same as new york city . david , would it be a good idea to rent a car here ? i 've got an international driver 's license with a pretty good record in the states . _eos
_go that 's wonderful . ok . i 'll remember that . but i have to warn you that you must drive very carefully in the downtown area , for there 're no separate lanes for motor vehicles and bicycles in some places , and still quite a few people do n't take road regulations seriously . _eos
_go you ca n't really tell everything about a house from the outside . let 's go inside . _eos
_go i do n't think that it is looking any better inside here . _eos
_go i think that fresh paint and cleaning would help it look a little better . _eos
_go it is just too dark in here with so few windows . _eos
_go i hear that the kitchen is quite large . let 's go check it out . _eos
_go the kitchen may be large , but it does n't have any storage space . _eos
_go the master suite is supposed to be quite elegant . maybe it will be a little better . _eos

_go yes , i do . i have worked as a salesman for p & g company ltd . _eos
_go do people respond well to you ? _eos
_go yes , i 'm good with people . _eos
_go this is the place i was telling you about . _eos
_go would you like to sit near the window ? _eos
_go good . _eos
_go let 's have a look at the menu . oh , there is n't a menu . do you think you could ask the people at the next table if we could look at their menu ? _eos
_go yes , of course . excuse me . could you possibly let us see your menu ? oh . they have n't got one either . _eos
_go i 'm thinking about it . how much is it ? _eos
_go ¥ 350 . _eos
_go oh , dear . it 's too expensive . can you give me a better price ? _eos
_go your discount is already included . normally we charge ¥ 400 , but now we can give you a special price . this is our sale period . _eos
_go it 's still too much . ca n't you make it any cheaper than that ? _eos
_go sorry , but this is the best price . you ca n't get it any cheaper than here . _eos
_go i see . can i pay by traveler 's checks ? _eos
_go i 'm afraid you ca n't . you 're welcome to pay in cash . _eos
_go sure . what do you need ? _eos
_go i 'm having some trouble . how do you use this printer ? _eos
_go well , first you have to turn this switch on . _eos
_go silly me . _eos
_go now press this button . _eos
_go oh , and it 's out of paper . do you have any more ? _eos
_go just a second . i 'll go get some . _eos
_go tell me what the problem is . _eos
_go i ca n't figure out how to turn them on . _eos
_go do you have some quarters ? _eos
_go i did n't know i needed change . _eos
_go the washer costs 50 cents and the dryer costs a dollar . _eos
_go where do i put the change ? _eos
_go the quarters go into the slot . you have to push the slot in , and the machine will turn on . _eos
_go is that everything that i have to do ? _eos
_go that 's all there is . _eos
_go i appreciate you helping me with this . _eos
_go if you need anything else , just let me know . _eos
_go yes , do i have to work a whole year before i can take a vacation ? _eos
_go yes , after you 've been here a year , you qualify for a three - day vacation _eos
_go only three days ? _eos
_go that 's the company policy . _eos
_go what happens if i use up my sick days before the end of the year ? if i 'm sick an extra day or two , will my pay be deducted ? _eos
_go yes . that 's the company policy . _eos
_go it was the same as the last place i worked at . i was hoping you 'd be different . _eos
_go yeah . i am too . _eos
_go where did you want to go for lunch ? _eos
_go i was thinking we should just go to the cafeteria . _eos
_go i do n't think i ever got food from the cafeteria . _eos
_go i actually like the food there . _eos
_go does the cafeteria sell a lot of different food ? _eos
_go they have anything you want . _eos
_go i was thinking about getting some chinese food . _eos
_go i bought some chow mein at the cafeteria . it tasted great . _eos
_go we can eat at the cafeteria . _eos
_go i think you 'll really like the food there . _eos
_go that 's ok . _eos
_go the contract is to be written in chinese and english . both languages are equally effective . _eos
_go fine . if you 'll excuse me , i 'd like to go it over first . ( after about 15 minutes ) hmm , you 've done a pretty good job . it 's well prepared . _eos
_go thank you . _eos
_go well , i suggest that we discuss only the clauses and points where we have different opinions just to save time . _eos
_go that 's a good idea . _eos
_go first , let 's read clause two about packing . it 's our usual practice to ship our products in containers . that 'll save time and money , but your contract stipulates the use of wooden cases . so , we 'd like to have the words containers are allowed in the contract . _eos
_go agreed . _eos
_go for shipment , you know we are producing a complete set of equipment for you and it wo n't all be finished at one time . so would you allow us to make partial shipments . _eos
_go i understand your position . _eos
_go certainty . do you want double breasted suit or single breasted suit ? _eos
_go i prefer single breasted suit . _eos
_go what about this one ? it 's a very nice 3 - piece suit . _eos
_go that looks great . do you have ties here ? _eos
_go how do you do , jack . nice to meet you . _eos
_go well , i think you 've reconsidered our proposal , diane . _eos
_go yes , you are right . after all , the quality of your air conditioners is good . the only problem is price . _eos
_go i should not be surprised , many customers have the same opinion . do you have any suggestion in mind ? our salesman told your secretary that the price could be negotiable . _eos
_go that 's why i came to your office today . we think for your model we - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579 - 649 . _eos
_go that 's true . but if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you 'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount . _eos
_go i see your point . that 's to say s 611 each set . still it 's much higher than the market price . could you see your way to reduce the price , jack ? _eos
_go well , considering the quantity of your order we could further reduce the price to 600 . that 's the best we can do . what do you think of that ? _eos
_go all right . we accept it . so $ 600 for each set . _eos
_go very well . thank you . _eos
_go i 'm not sure . you look familiar . _eos
_go you 're mr . stevenson , right ? _eos
_go yes . and you 're mr . jones , i remember . _eos
_go yes , i have an overall understanding . _eos
_go when we have the final results , we will call you . _eos
_go then when will i get a reply at the latest ? _eos
_go if you pass the interview , the personnel department will inform you within two weeks . _eos
_go but if i do n't pass , will you call me ? _eos
_go i 'm sorry we wo n't . you can wait for two weeks . if you do n't get a telephone call , it means that you were n't successful . _eos
_go then do i have the chance to get this job ? _eos
_go i 'm sorry but i ca n't make the final decision myself , and i have to discuss it with other interviewers . _eos
_go i know . no matter what the result will be , i have learned a lot from our conversation . _eos
_go your mentality is very good and that 's great . _eos
_go thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview . _eos
_go my pleasure . _eos
_go well , you 'd better lie down now . you need a good rest . _eos
_go all right . i 'll do that . _eos
_go i 'm quite active and energetic . i approach things enthusiastically and i do n't like to leave things half - done . _eos
_go do you think you are introverted or extroverted ? _eos
_go i 'm quite outgoing i think . i enjoy mixing and doing things with others . _eos
_go what do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? _eos
_go i maintain that the most important thing is having good friends . a person ca n't live all by himself i think . a friend in need is a friend in deed . the more really close friends i have , the better . _eos
_go what kind of people do you like to work with ? _eos
_go people who are honest , dedicated to their work and having integrity . _eos
_go hello , everybody . i am monica and this is my first day at work . i am working in the finance department . i am very happy to meet everyone and i am looking forward to working well with all of you . i am very happy to be one of the team and i will do my best to get into the working situation as soon as possible . by the way , call me monica . everybody calls me so . _eos
_go yes . i was president of the student council of our university . _eos
_go did you get any honors or awards at your university ? _eos
_go yes . i was elected excellent party member for four academic years . _eos
_go were you involved in any club activities at your university ? _eos
_go yes . i was a member of the student poetry society . i like writing poems in my spare time . _eos
_go what extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college ? _eos
_go i sometimes played table tennis and sometimes played basketball . _eos
_go what 's the criteria for staff to attend ? are we only including our management team in this affair ? or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend ? _eos
_go lower level employees need not attend . the purpose of this retreat is for training , especially for our management team . we want to develop a well - oiled machine on our executive level . in order to get everyone to jell together , we 've got to include some fun . that 's the reason for the retreat . _eos
_go why ? _eos
_go because it does n't require a lot of energy and thus easy to keep up . _eos
_go but i see people sweat a lot doing yoga too . _eos
_go i do n't know . i just need to try it once . i 'm in urgent need of some exercise to lose some weight . _eos
_go you should try swimming then . it helps you to keep fit . _eos
_go i think my english is fairly good . as you can see from my cv , i graduated from university with a b . a . degree in english . i studied the english language and english literature systematically . _eos
_go how are your typing and shorthand skills ? _eos
_go i can type 80 words a minute , basically no mistake , and can take dictation in english at 120 words per minute . _eos
_go yes . when can i get them back ? _eos
_go well , if they are collected right now , you can get them back tonight . _eos
_go that 's fine . by the way , please have that suit dry cleaned . _eos
_go ok . please fill in the form first . _eos
_go is your blood pressure , i 'm afraid . it 's far too high . _eos
_go and what 's the cause of that ? _eos
_go overwork - amongst other things . you ca n't work 24 hours a day . you 've got to slow down . _eos
_go but i ca n't just slow down . _eos
_go you 've got to , i 'm afraid . and look at this . you weigh 200 stones . that 's too much for a man of your size . _eos
_go you mean i 've got to lose weight ? _eos
_go yes . you 've got to cut down on bread and potatoes and take more exercise . _eos
_go exercise . the morning hours are the most precious period within a single day . we should not pass them up easily . seize the time and do something useful . _eos
_go so , you choose to spend it on bodybuilding . where do you exercise ? _eos
_go usually , i run to the black bamboo park as a warm - up . admission is free . then i start my activities . _eos
_go do you do the same exercises every day ? _eos
_go no , i 've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars , push - ups , sit - ups , bunny - hops , five - kilometer run , and so on . i alternate them over the weekdays . sometimes , when i find myself in a bad state , i will simply idle about in the park . _eos
_go why do n't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising ? _eos
_go it 's not easy to keep a good habit , you know . i fear that if i fail to get up early one day , i may find it still more difficult to rise early the next . besides , a mere walk in the early morning is much fun , too . here and there in the park , you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs , playing er'hu , chess , or just chatting and gossiping . it 's interesting to join them . _eos
_go oh , yes . singing is also a good way of keeping fit , at least mentally . _eos
_go i think pond 's is the best . _eos
_go and they 're very dear , too . _eos
_go they 're on special offer today . _eos
_go oh , that 's ideal . _eos
_go first , you should have enough sleep to get over the jet lag before the departure . most people will suffer from jet lag for a few days after a long flight . _eos
_go i will go to bed early tonight . _eos
_go do you have an airsickness ? _eos
_go i do n't know . but i have a carsickness . _eos
_go you 'd better bring some medicine for airsickness . _eos
_go thank you . _eos
_go can you do that in the mornings , or would the afternoons be best ? _eos
_go either way is good for me . _eos
_go there are a number of open houses this weekend in your area . would that okay with you ? _eos
_go i can take a little time off of work , or i can go on a weekend , also . _eos
_go we could meet at the real estate office , or i could pick you up at your home . _eos
_go i am leaving from work , so maybe i could just meet you at the first house that we will look at . _eos
_go i can think of five houses that we should look at . it will take most of the day . _eos
_go i would like to see as many as possible . _eos
_go when i have confirmed the times with the owners , i will e - mail you our plans for the day . _eos
_go yes , here is the table , which plans do you like best ? _eos
_go the seven - days trip shall be fine . how much is this tour ? _eos
_go $ 300 . _eos
_go we will take the trip . could you give us a pamphlet ? _eos
_go here you are . _eos
_go what do you mean ? _eos
_go now , i am responsible for training new staff , but you keep overriding my authority by trying to pose your methods . i know you are a hotshot college graduate with something to prove . but i do n't like your way . _eos
_go enough is enough . i know . _eos
_go i 'm sorry , mrs . lin . we do n't allow smoking in the office . _eos
_go i want to american breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up . _eos

_go that 's all right . we 'll teach you . _eos
_go is it anything like american football ? _eos

_go good idea . i think you 'll like it if you give it a chance . _eos

_go you sound exhausted . maybe you should hire a nanny to help you out ! she can pick the kids up and take them to their after - school activities . she can also help you do some household chores , and run so _eos
_go oh , i do n't know ... it 's hard to find the right nanny . you have to consider her previous work experience , the responsibilities you give her , and how she interacts with the kids . i would love to have _eos
_go i think you should definitely consider it ! this way you wo n't have to juggle such a busy schedule , and you 'll still get to spend time with the kids in the evenings . i can refer you this great _eos
_go oh , that 's great . thanks grace . can you give me her number ? i 'll talk it over with dan and give her a call tomorrow . maybe this way i wo n't be so tired every day , and dan and i might even get to go _eos

_go how about this picture of cranes with pine trees ? it was painted by a famous chinese painter in king dynasty . _eos
_go oh , they look just like live cranes . _eos

_go yeah ? can i take a look at the sirs you carry ? _eos
_go sure thing , follow me . this here is the . _eos

_go yeah , but what kit lens does this camera come with ? i do n't want some bulky telephoto lens . _eos

_go thank you . you 've been very helpful . _eos
_go that 's certainly true . but , that 's what this job is all about , maria . there 's no doubt that this project is unacceptable . _eos
_go i agree . but i think that we can handle the problem by making a few major changes . i 'd appreciate it if you would give me a chance . _eos
_go all right , maria . i 'll give you until tomorrow at 4:00 to produce a satisfactory piece of work , but otherwise , you 'll have to re - do it . _eos
_go you do ? how are you going to contact him ? _eos
_go i 'm leaving him a message taped to my computer screen . _eos
_go what does it say ? do you think he 'll see it ? _eos
_go he 'll see it . it says , i like sweets . meet me at two thirty in the parking lot . _eos
_go can i spy on you guys from the window ? _eos
_go no . but i 'll fill you in later . right now i have to find vince . _eos
_go i 'd like to have some more . it 's really good . _eos
_go no , you 'll have to get off at the bank , and take a no . 50 . _eos
_go thank you . how much is the fare to that stop ? _eos

_go no , a no . 50 will take you right there . _eos
_go thank you . _eos
_go very well . we started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done . the only thing that is n't ready yet is my wedding dress . _eos
_go when will that be ready ? _eos
_go the dressmakers said that is would be ready in two weeks . _eos
_go you 're getting married in three weeks . so that should be ok . so , you 've prepared the church , catering , transport , hotel - everything . _eos
_go yes . we 've taken care of all of that . we decided not to get married in a church though . neither of us is very religious . _eos
_go which hotel will the reception be held at ? _eos
_go the palace hotel they 're taking care of the catering , including the wedding cake . i 'm sure they 'll do a good job . _eos
_go oh , yes . it 's and excellent hotel . a friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . _eos
_go yes . it will be expensive , but we think it will be worth it . it gives us great peace of mind to know that our reception is in the hands of experienced people . _eos
_go i think you make the right decision . _eos
_go yes . actually our range of sweaters is the most comprehensive available . _eos
_go can i try this one on ? _eos
_go sure , go ahead . _eos
_go the color is too bright . for my age , i would prefer a lighter color . _eos
_go coffee ? i do n't honestly like that kind of stuff . _eos
_go come on , you can at least try a little , besides your cigarette . _eos
_go what 's wrong with that ? cigarette is the thing i go crazy for . _eos
_go not for me , dick . _eos
_go let 's see , sir . according to your file , you watched'titanic'monday evening . _eos
_go well , the wrong information is in my file . i was at a concert monday night . _eos
_go well , your word overrules the file , sir . one moment , please . _eos
_go i knew you 'd see it my way . _eos
_go sir , i deleted the $ 10 , but i had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill . _eos
_go am i in the twilight zone ? you 're charging me for a movie i never saw ? _eos
_go please do n't blame me , sir . blame the computer programmer . _eos
_go this is highway robbery . i 've got a good mind to call the police ! _eos
_go if it makes you feel any better , other guests feel the same way . _eos
_go how nice of him . i 'll be delighted to go . but what time would be convenient ? _eos
_go if you could be ready by , say 6:30 o'clock , i 'll be at the hotel to pick you up . _eos
_go that 's great . it 's most thoughtful of you to do this , miss rose . _eos
_go it 's my pleasure . well , then . i 'll say goodbye . _eos
_go goodbye and see you tonight . miss rose . _eos
_go sorry , but he 's not in . may i take a message for you ? _eos
_go this is robert jordan . would you ask him to call me back , please ? _eos
_go ok , i 'll tell him . _eos
_go yes , of course . here it is . _eos
_go thank you . are all these yours ? _eos
_go no , some of them are my friend 's . do you want her passport , too ? _eos
_go yes , please . do you have any carry - on items ? _eos
_go do you want me to put it on the belt , too ? _eos
_go yes , please . would you please open this big suitcase ? _eos
_go ok . just a moment . it 's just some clothes and toiletries . _eos
_go ok . do you have anything to declare ? _eos
_go i think there is nothing . _eos
_go any fresh food , live plants , or animals ? _eos
_go oh , no . none of that . _eos
_go thank you . you may lock up your suitcase . here are your passports . _eos
_go thanks a lot . _eos
_go yes ? _eos
_go i bought it one size up by mistake . _eos
_go oh , did you ? _eos
_go i wonder if you can change it to one size down . _eos
_go yes , of course . will you come with the receipt ? _eos
_go then i 'll come to your place later in the evening , and how late is your shop open ? _eos
_go until 8 o'clock , ma'am . we are looking forward to seeing you . _eos
_go no idea . your guess is as good as mine . _eos
_go it better be more than last year . _eos
_go well , anything is better than nothing . wait and see . _eos
_go why , do we need groceries ? _eos
_go i believe we are all out of food . _eos
_go do you know what to get ? _eos
_go i do n't know what we need . _eos
_go why do n't you go and check the refrigerator ? _eos
_go i would appreciate it if you would do that for me . _eos
_go why do n't you just get the basics ? _eos
_go what do you mean ? _eos
_go eggs , milk , bread . things like that . _eos
_go go make that list . _eos
_go sure , no problem . _eos
_go since we have reached an agreement on all terms , there should n't be any problems for the contract . _eos
_go may we once more remind you that the contract should be canceled by one month notice . _eos
_go yes , i got it . thanks . _eos
_go yes , can i help you ? _eos
_go well , this is my baggage claim tag . can you get my baggage now ? _eos
_go ok , here you are . _eos
_go thanks a lot . _eos
_go i was unable to make it . _eos
_go you should have been there . it was intense . _eos
_go is that right . who ended up winning ? _eos
_go our team was victorious . _eos
_go i wish i was free that night . i 'm kind of mad that i did n't go . _eos
_go it was a great game . _eos
_go what was the score at the end of the game ? _eos
_go our team won 101 - 98 . _eos
_go sounds like it was a close game . _eos
_go that 's the reason it was such a great game . _eos
_go the next game , i will definitely be there . _eos
_go no , never . i prefer to actually see and touch what i 'm buying before i pay for it , especially for clothes and shoes . _eos
_go that 's right . seeing is believing . _eos
_go i 've heard some friends say when they get the article , it 's quite different from what they see on the website advertisement . _eos
_go that happens . without close quality examination , we may encounter fraud , and the e - shop may suddenly disappear . _eos
_go what 's more , it 's not always so safe for us to pay online as hackers might steal the user name and password . _eos
_go it 's said that some measures have been taken to deal with this problem . paying online is much safer than before , but i still have the feeling that it 's not safe enough . _eos
_go i ca n't agree more . that 's why i only do street shopping . _eos
_go me too . sometimes i surf online shops to check some related information , and then go to a physical store to do the actual shopping . _eos
_go that 's a good idea . _eos
_go it is 15 minutes'drive . _eos
_go what companies do we have in our neighborhood ? _eos
_go mitsubishi , hp , ibm and many other famous corporations . _eos
_go does the 7th floor belong to our company too ? _eos
_go yes , our company has two floors , the 6th and 7th floor in this building . _eos
_go it 's such a large firm . do we have our own staff restaurant ? _eos
_go yes , at the end of the hall . _eos
_go good morning , i have an appointment with mr . johnson at 10:00 _eos
_go excuse me , sir , but are you mr . richard of world trading company ? _eos
_go yes . that 's right . _eos
_go i 'm sorry , mr . richard . mr . johnson is on his way to the office . he had just called and asked you to wait a minute . _eos
_go well , i 'll wait . _eos
_go would you like something to drink , sir ? do you prefer coffee or tea ? _eos
_go thank you . coffee , please . _eos
_go here you are , mr . richard . this is the cream and this is the sugar . if there 's anything else you 'd like , please do n't hesitate to tell me . _eos
_go thank you very much . _eos
_go i need to report a break - in . _eos
_go when did this break - in occur ? _eos
_go last night . _eos
_go where did the break - in happen ? _eos
_go it happened at my house . _eos
_go was anything taken ? _eos
_go i 'm not sure yet . _eos
_go what makes you think there was a break - in ? _eos
_go my front window was busted . _eos
_go i 'll send a squad car . _eos
_go please hurry . _eos
_go you do n't need to introduce yourself , yang . you 're famous . _eos
_go well , thank you very much but i thought l'd try and chair the meeting by the rule -- at least for a while . _eos
_go ok , ok ! _eos
_go now , i 'd like to get things under way . the main topic on today 's agenda is the development of a u . s . sales strategy for the new ebb . i 'd like to hear all of your ideas , mr . wall , you seem in top form today . could you start the ball rolling ? _eos
_go uh , oh , sure . well , i think we should keep in mind that the key to good sales is advertising . _eos
_go well , that 's kind of obvious . _eos
_go give me a break , mr yang . _eos
_go uh , let 's keep this going , shall we ? _eos
_go what do you mean ? _eos
_go it looks like the shipping company did this . _eos
_go we 'd better take it up with them , in that case . _eos
_go no problem , if possible i always combine business with pleasure . now , let 's hear more about these chocolates you 're offering . _eos
_go well , as you know , i have recently become the sole distributor for grangers gourmet bon - bons here in the united states . they 're a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market . naturally , your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately . i think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant , luxurious , first class dining . _eos
_go mmmm , sounds interesting ... gourmet chocolates , where are they produced ? belgium ? _eos
_go actually , the factory is located in scotland . _eos
_go really ? i did n't think they were known for their luxury chocolate production _eos
_go that 's what makes this such a fantastic opportunity ! the government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units . they 've also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well . here , i brought these especially for you , try one ! _eos
_go oh , thanks . mmm , hmm , creamy texture , very smooth ... _eos
_go unique , are n't they ? i bet you 've never tasted anything like it ! quality is assured as i personally visit the factory to make sure no one 's cutting corners with the ingredients . only the creme make it through inspection . _eos
_go yes , very interesting flavors ... slightly spicy , very unique , that 's for sure . exactly what are the ingredients ? _eos
_go i have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the granger family for generations . i 'm sure you can keep a secret . buttermilk , cacao beans , sugar and haggis . _eos
_go haggis ? what 's haggis ? _eos
_go it 's a traditional scottish delicacy , you take sheep 's liver , heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep 's stomach . _eos
_go ah , get back to you . _eos
_go mr . johnson ? mr . johnson ? _eos
_go yes , we are just looking for one . what 's the charge per day ? _eos
_go it 's $ 20 . if you are staying for more than 3 days in the city , the charge is $ 16 per day . _eos
_go that 's reasonable . _eos
_go yes , that 's right . _eos
_go i believe we met at a concert last year . i 'm taylor . _eos
_go oh , yes . i remember . _eos
_go monica , wait a moment . i think we 'd better call the repair man to do it . _eos
_go i think i can handle it by myself . _eos
_go i 'd like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company . _eos
_go i see . if i got hurt when fixing the light , even during office hours , i would n't get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility . _eos
_go other company rules also need your attention . _eos
_go like this one ? never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder . yeah , thank you for telling me . _eos
_go do n't mention it . _eos
_go when did you finish ? _eos
_go this morning ! no more overtime , and no more headaches ! _eos
_go well , i 'm glad to hear it . have a cup of coffee ! _eos
_go did you mail us your last continued claim form ? _eos
_go i am afraid that i forgot to send it in . _eos
_go we can not pay you unless you turn that form in every two weeks . _eos
_go is it too late to mail the continued claim form in now ? _eos
_go it ca n't be more than fourteen days late for us to accept it . _eos
_go i will mail it in a little early next time to avoid this problem . _eos
_go you ca n't possibly know in advance how much you will be working . if you mail it in too soon , we will reject it ! _eos
_go will my paycheck arrive late because i messed up on my form ? _eos
_go your check will be arriving late , but the next one will come right on time . _eos
_go i 'm ready when you are , sir . _eos
_go very good ! now , it 's still morning here in new york . _eos
_go you are so right , sir . the clock just struck nine . _eos
_go i 'm going to spend some time exploring the city . what can i do with my luggage ? _eos
_go sir , right here we have a storage site . its only $ 5 an hour , but you need to leave a deposit . _eos
_go a deposit ? is n't my luggage a deposit ? _eos
_go i 'm sorry , sir , but it is n't . your mastercard or visa will take care of things nicely . _eos
_go okay . let me think about this . _eos
_go okay , sir . but do n't take too long . you only have 30 minutes . _eos
_go yes . i 'd like a cup of onion soup . _eos
_go and what would you like after that ? _eos
_go i 'd like the roast chicken , please . _eos
_go yes , i know and i like it very much . i will take it . _eos
_go sure . here is your receipt . _eos
_go how long is this cell phone guaranteed ? _eos
_go you can refund it in 7 days and exchange it in one year . _eos
_go it was alright . i ran into bill and we got to talking for a while . he 's in a bit of a jam . _eos
_go why ? what happened ? _eos
_go well , his son had an accident and bill does n't have health insurance . this really got me thinking , and i wondered if we should n't look into a couple of different hmo 's . _eos
_go yeah , you 're right . we are n't getting any younger and our kids are getting older . _eos
_go exactly ! i searched on the web and found a couple of hmo 's with low co - pays and good coverage . the deductibles are low , too . _eos
_go sounds good , although , do you think we can qualify for insurance ? those insurance companies are real pirates when it comes to money . _eos
_go well , we do n't have any pre - existing illnesses or conditions , so we should be fine . _eos
_go i wish our company or country provided us with healthcare . _eos
_go not in a million years ! _eos
_go yes , of course . there are many steps . you can apply for the job on the internet and then send your resume to the e - mail address of the company . and wail the feedback of the company . _eos
_go what is the qualification needed by the position ? _eos
_go you must have over 2 years'experience first . _eos
_go played poker with my work friends . _eos
_go did you win ? _eos
_go of course . _eos
_go can i see your passbook and the withdrawal slip , please ? _eos
_go sure . _eos
_go let me just make sure . you want to withdraw one thousand dollars ? _eos
_go that 's right . _eos
_go yes of course . this is a really good one actually . _eos
_go how much does it cost ? _eos
_go this one is 1500 yuan . _eos
_go it looks pretty good . i think i 'll take it . _eos
_go would you like anything else ? _eos
_go that 's all thank you . _eos
_go what is that ? it looks like something from a swamp ! _eos
_go it 's a green drink . it 's supposed to be full of vitamins and minerals . _eos
_go you know , healthy eating does n't have to make you gag . _eos
_go the sales lady said that even if i eat right , i would n't get enough vitamins . _eos
_go have you ever tried it ? or are you just going to believe the sales lady ? _eos
_go it 's easier to drink this once a day than eat fruit and vegetables all day . _eos
_go it may take less time , but i do n't know about easier . yuck . _eos
_go i 'm sorry i 'm late . i overslept . is the manager here today ? _eos
_go yes he 's in his office . _eos
_go oh , i hope he did n't notice me . _eos
_go do n't take any chances . it 'd be best if you told him and promised not to be late again . he 's already mad at you for last 2 times . any more and he might fire you . _eos

_go oh , really ? are there any snakes ? _eos
_go snakes ? there are even rodents and monkeys ! it 's a world of exotic pets . _eos
_go that 's terrific . i ca n't wait to check it out . _eos
_go hang on . are you sure you want to keep a non - traditional pet ? _eos
_go why not ? it 's so cool . _eos
_go but it will pose a risk to your health . _eos
_go pardon ? _eos
_go i mean , most reptiles carry some harmful bacteria , they are likely to cause immune system problems . _eos
_go well , i did n't realize that . _eos
_go i do n't believe it 's a good choice to keep those pets , especially for families with young children . _eos

_go i am sorry to have kept you waiting . mr . johns needs a telephone call from you . _eos

_go then i 'll come down and pick up the message immediately . _eos
_go ok , we wait for you . _eos
_go what is it ? _eos
_go well , you know how i 've been working at the economist as a proof - reader , right ? _eos
_go yes . _eos
_go well , the editor - in - chief heard that i had experience as an editor at another magadize and asked me if i was interested in becoming an assistant editor for him . _eos
_go really ? that 's fantastic ! will you get a chance to do any writing ? _eos
_go she said that the columnist for the literary criticism column would be going on pregnancy leave soon and that i could be in charge of the column until she came back . _eos
_go wow ! that 's really great news . how often does the magazine come out ? _eos
_go it 's a monthly magazine , but my column will be shared with another columnist so my articles will be due fortnightly . _eos
_go are you looking forward to doing more editing work ? _eos
_go yes , but i 'm even more excited about getting my thoughts published again ! _eos
_go do you have any order forms here so that i can get a subscription to the magazine ? _eos
_go i do n't have any with me , but i think i could manage to bring a free copy home for you . _eos
_go i 'm really looking forward to reading your column . _eos
_go me , too . do you want to go out to celebrate my good news ? _eos
_go sure , where would you like to go ? _eos
_go perhaps we could go to the library festival that 's going on at the local bookshop . _eos
_go i think i may have seen it on the kitchen table . _eos
_go you 're right , thanks . there 's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that i want to finish . _eos
_go who 's the director ? _eos
_go it 's martin scorsese . you liked his film , the departed , did n't you ? _eos
_go yes , it was fantastic ! can i read the article when you 're finished ? _eos
_go sure . you know it has an online edition , too . you should go online to read if you want to read it now . _eos
_go that 's ok . i 'll wait until you 're finished . just out of curiosity , do you have a subscription for that magadize ? _eos
_go no . i do n't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile . _eos
_go how much does the magadize cost ? _eos
_go it 's almost three pounds now , and i think they 're going to put the price up to four pounds soon . _eos
_go that 's quite expensive . who is their target audience ? _eos
_go cosmo mainly has a middle - class readership , but i think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore . _eos
_go i bet you 'll still buy it , though . you would n't be able to live without your fashion magazine ! _eos
_go bargain ? i 'd feel way too guilty . _eos
_go but you could have saved money . _eos
_go from a sweet ma ? ! it 's not worth it . plus , i 'd happily pay more for these things i bought ! _eos
_go f . y . i . , there is a flea market nearby , but maybe you 're done ... _eos
_go ha ! i 'm just warming up ! please take me there now ! _eos
_go sure . what do you want to find ? _eos
_go i want to find information on the american civil war . _eos
_go well , can you be more specific ? there are a lot of websites about that . _eos
_go yes , i want to know about the battle of gettysburg . _eos
_go o . k . well , go to google . com , and type in " battle of gettysburg . " _eos
_go oh wow , there are a lot of sites . _eos
_go here , try this one . it 's a good site about gettysburg . _eos
_go thanks . _eos
_go for detailed information , however , you should read a history book . _eos
_go thanks . if i 'm interested , i 'll go to the library . _eos
_go ok . you 'd better come back in two hours . _eos
_go i 'm afraid he 's away from his desk at the moment . _eos
_go do you know when he will be back ? _eos
_go he 's away on a business trip . he wo n't be back until some time next week . _eos
_go is there some way i can get into contact with him ? _eos
_go the best way to reach him is by cell phone . i 'll give you his number . _eos
_go thanks . and could i have his e - mail , just in case i ca n't get him by phone ? _eos
_go sure . his cell phone is 09112223 33 . and his e - mail is lower case t , smith -- that 's one word , at , c , c , w , dot , com , dot , t , w . _eos
_go thank you so much . does he read his e - mails daily ? _eos

_go try to get outdoors more and be sure to get more rest . _eos
_go thank you , doctor . i 'll do as you say . _eos
_go morning , michael . i 've been very busy lately . one of our other vendors is going out of business and i 've been searching for a suitable replacement . _eos
_go well , rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run , sitdown . coffee ? _eos
_go no , thanks . i 've been trying to cut down on the caffeine . _eos
_go haha , i could never do that . i 'd be a zombie if i did n't have my morning coffee fix . let 's get down to business then . _eos
_go yes . i 've come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . the demand for phone cameras is growing , and pear has been falling behind in the market . _eos
_go that 's great ! i 'm glad to hear that pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . is pear still interested in having those ? _eos
_go no , we 're changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . we were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal . _eos
_go surely . let 's get started by drafting a new contract . _eos
_go you have ordered a red dress , is that right ? _eos
_go yes . is that available now ? _eos

_go that 's insane . _eos
_go i was so scared when i saw the gun . _eos
_go then what happened ? _eos
_go he took the money and tried to get away . _eos
_go did the cops show up in time ? _eos
_go he did n't even make it out the door . _eos
_go hello ! i was exhausted form studying , so i decided to read the newspaper to relax . unfortunately , the news is so depressing . there has been another murder in the city center . i 'm shocked that the pole _eos
_go people are starting to get frightened by it . everyone will be relieved when they finally catch the murder . _eos
_go you mean if they catch the murderer . i 'm scared stiff about going into the city center at night . _eos
_go there must have been some good news in the newspaper . i ca n't believe that none of the news stories make you happy or excited . _eos
_go well , there was one good piece of news . you remember the local girl who was dying of a rare blood disease ? _eos
_go yes . her parents were raising money to have her treated in the united states . _eos
_go well , they 've got the money and she 's going tomorrow for treatment . _eos
_go i 'm so happy for the family ! they must be very relieved and excited about that . _eos
_go i 'm sure they are . oh , and a local man won the lottery . i 'm so jealous ! i wish it were me ! i buy a lottery ticket every week and i 'm amazed that i have n't even won a small prize yet . it 's so unfair ! _eos
_go do n't be moody ! i hope you 're not tired , because we 've been invited to a party this evening . i know how excited you get about parties . _eos
_go let me see . the bell - bottom pants are $ 90 and the coat is $ 120 . it comes to $ 210 . _eos

_go do you take milk or sugar with your tea ? _eos
_go i 'll take a little milk , but no sugar , please . make sure you let the tea steep a few minutes before you take the tea bag out of the cup . _eos
_go ok . what do you think about our living room ? _eos
_go well , i do like the mantelpiece and the coffee table , but i do n't really care for curtains . did you get them at a yard sale ? they look ancient . _eos
_go my parents gave them to us as a house warming gift . _eos
_go oh dear . well , i suppose they will do for now . do you ever dust in here ? it seems a bit dusty in here . _eos
_go your daughter usually does the dusting , and i do the vacuuming . _eos

_go do you know any places ? _eos

_go you can also check out university bulletin boards . _eos

_go we have thought of you carefully with discretion , but the other candidate has more experiences . _eos
_go experience is important , but do n't you think capability is more valuable than that ? _eos
_go yes , i think so . but how do you prove to me that you are more capable ? _eos
_go maybe you can hire me on trial . if i 'm not qualified for the job , you can let me go . _eos
_go good idea . _eos
_go yes , the nearest one is at the third cross of this road . _eos
_go i 'm a stranger here . how can i get there , please ? _eos
_go just walk down the road for a few minutes , and you 'll find it on your right . _eos
_go thank you very much . _eos
_go so , this 500 rib is worthless ? _eos
_go i 'm sorry but it is our regulation , so i must follow it . we will issue you with a receipt to show that the notes you presented us with are counterfeit and have been confiscated . then , if you wish to pay in some more cash , you are free to do so . _eos
_go right , i see . let me give you another 500 rib . _eos
_go here 's your passbook back and the receipt to say we confiscated the 500 rib worth of counterfeit notes . _eos
_go thanks . now can i make the full deposit ? _eos
_go yes . please fill in a new deposit slip and we can continue . _eos
_go do we have to ? _eos
_go come on , it 's losing needles all the time and the branches are sagging . _eos
_go it 's not that bad , besides it really looks nice in that corner . it gives the room a good atmosphere . _eos
_go a good atmosphere ? the tree is falling apart , and it 's messing up the room . _eos
_go but it makes the place feel so much like christmas . i 'd really hate to have to take it down . _eos
_go but christmas was two weeks ago ! it 's been there only because we 've been too busy to get rid of it . _eos
_go i know , but it seems like such a shame to have to take it away . _eos
_go but it 's falling apart , and the cat keeps playing with the lower branches . _eos
_go i know , i know . but it reminds me of the great christmas we just had . all of us were here - - my parents , your parents , the kids , and the cousins - - the food was good , and everybody got what they wanted . _eos
_go yeah , it was a good christmas . it wo n't always be this good , but we ca n't make it last longer than it should . _eos
_go ok , fine . we need to take down the tree . _eos
_go i 'll make a deal with you . we 'll leave it up until sunday , and then we 'll take it down after church . _eos
_go i 'm ask for a pizza , please . _eos
_go then you will be happy to here that today all our pizzas are on sale . two for one . _eos
_go you 're right , that is great . _eos

_go that would be to go . _eos
_go that 'll be in a ten minutes . please sit over there , and i 'll call you over as sooner as it 's ready . _eos
_go no problem . _eos

_go when should i take them ? _eos
_go take on after each meal . _eos
_go how long should i continue taking them ? _eos
_go take them for two days . if your symptoms persist for more than two days , you should see a doctor also , be sure to drink plenty of water to prevent dehydration . _eos
_go thank you for your advice . _eos
_go yes . i want a window seat definitely , in the smoking section . _eos
_go sure . please put your baggage on scale . _eos

_go yeah , of course . you can take a taxi . _eos

_go it depends on traffic and distance , but it is reasonable . _eos
_go do the drivers speak english ? _eos
_go some are better than others . but , you should n't have a problem . _eos
_go are they safe ? _eos
_go for the most part , yes . if you do n't feel comfortable with it , then it is best not to take one at night . _eos
_go sure . what time do you want to go ? _eos
_go how about at 3:30 ? _eos
_go that sounds good . today we work on legs and forearm . _eos
_go hey . i just played basketball earlier , so my legs are a little sore . let 's work out on arms and stomach today . _eos

_go you 're so good with people . i think they will like you ! _eos
_go hello , yes , i 'd like to open a bank account . _eos
_go certainly , i can can help you with that . what type of account would you like to open ? a chequing or a savings account ? _eos
_go what what features do they offer ? _eos
_go well , if you just take a look here , see , with our chequing account , you can have unlimited daily transactions for a small monthly fee , and our savings account has a higher interest rate , but you must carry a minimum balance of $ 10,000 dollars . _eos
_go i see , well , i think i 'm more interested in a chequing account . i like to have easy access to my money . _eos
_go alright , then , with this chequing account you 'll be issued a debit card and a cheque book . will you require overdraft protection ? there is an extra fee for that . _eos
_go no , that wo n't be necessary . _eos
_go in that case , i 'll get you to fill out this paperwork . i 'll need your social insurance number , and two pieces of government i d . if you could just sign here , and here , and here . we 'll be all set . would you like to make a deposit today ? _eos
_go yes , i 'd like to deposit one billion dollars . _eos
_go sure . do you want to have the car washed ? _eos
_go yes , please . when can you get it done ? _eos
_go you can pick it up in half an hour . by the way , how are you going to pay , cash or credit ? _eos
_go by credit . _eos

_go oh , do n't worry , i will ! _eos
_go it 's nice to meet you , too . _eos
_go i am happy to be speaking to a presidential candidate . _eos
_go would you like to ask me anything ? _eos
_go what do you feel about gay marriage ? _eos
_go i think everyone has the right to love who they want . _eos
_go would you legalize gay marriage ? _eos
_go yes , i would . _eos
_go many people wo n't like that . _eos
_go i 'm sure they wo n't , but that 's my view on gay marriage . _eos
_go i really like you . _eos
_go i really appreciate that . _eos
_go this is mr . white speaking . _eos
_go hi . i understand that you have a house for sale , have n't you ? _eos
_go yes . _eos
_go i 'd like to know more about it . _eos
_go can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o'clock ? _eos
_go ok . i will be there . _eos
_go thank you for calling . goodbye . _eos
_go bye . _eos
_go all right . which room shall i have ? _eos
_go room 202 , but i 'm afraid we have to ask for a deposit of $ 200 . _eos
_go mr green , please . _eos
_go sorry , he 's out . _eos
_go what time you suspect back them ? _eos
_go sorry , i am not sure , can i take a message ? _eos
_go no , thanks . i 'll call back later . _eos
_go that 's fine . please call again later . _eos
_go ok , thank you . goodbye . _eos
_go no , there 's a definite difference . you know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they 're the financial control system . then there 's the ceo -- the chief executive officer . he 's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . if there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . it 's too dangerous . that 's the reason for a board of directors . the board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . they could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non - biased . _eos
_go how many people are on the board of directors ? _eos
_go usually not more than 15 , not less than 10 . they meet monthly , quarterly , or biannually to oversee an organization or company . they provide long term planing and vision , and also act as moral watchdogs rto keep the company in line . _eos
_go we would like to start you off at 1,500 yuan a month , not including bonus and overtime pay . we do n't give bonus every month , but we offer a semi - annual bonus . and you will receive two weeks paid vacation a year , as well . does it suit you ? _eos
_go yes , thank you . may i ask for an apartment ? _eos
_go no problem . we 'll supply you with an apartment of two bedrooms and a living room . _eos
_go sorry . you know the rules . _eos
_go but i want to watch tv now . _eos
_go that 's out of the question . _eos
_go please . _eos
_go not a chance . _eos
_go not even for an hour ? _eos
_go sorry , it 's impossible . _eos
_go she 's in the garden , jane . _eos
_go what 's she doing ? _eos
_go she 's sitting under the tree . _eos
_go is tim in the garden , too ? _eos
_go yes , he is . he 's climbing the tree . _eos
_go i beg your pardon ? who 's climbing the tree . _eos
_go tim is . _eos
_go what about the dog ? _eos
_go the dog 's in the garden , too . it 's running across the grass . it 's running after a cat . _eos
_go i have a sore throat and headache . _eos
_go do you feel tired ? _eos
_go yes , my whole body feels weak . and i really feel terrible . _eos
_go i 'm sorry to hear that . i 'll have to examine you . _eos
_go ok , go ahead . _eos
_go open your mouth and show me your tongue . say ah ... you have a bad cold . so you must stay in bed for a week . _eos
_go what fun ! normally i 'd love to , but i 'm afraid i have to work late tonight . we 've got to get the contract ready for miss king . _eos
_go oh , right . you 're busy with that contract . maybe you could join us later ? _eos
_go unfortunately , i just ca n't make it this time . i have to go straight home . it 's my second wedding anniversary , and we 're supposed to be having a big dinner susan would kill me if i missed it . _eos
_go happy anniversary ! sorry you wo n't be there . maybe some other time ? _eos
_go yeah , maybe . thanks , anyway . hope you guys have a great time ! _eos
_go not at all . the changing rooms are just this way . _eos
_go thanks . it 's a little tight . do you have any in a larger size ? _eos
_go sure . i 'll give you the next size up . that one is small , right ? _eos
_go yes . also , i 'm not so sure about the color . _eos
_go well . it does n't go with your skirt . i think the color itself is fine though . _eos
_go of course ! are you ? _eos
_go i plan to , but what day is the election ? _eos
_go you should know that . _eos
_go can you just tell me ? _eos
_go the election is this tuesday . _eos
_go are you serious ? _eos
_go i 'm not kidding . _eos
_go it 's a good thing i asked you . _eos
_go that should 've been something you knew already . _eos
_go i could n't remember . _eos
_go whatever . just make sure you go vote . _eos
_go zina , why are you whispering ? _eos
_go i 've been talking to webtracker . i 'm thinking of jumping ship . _eos
_go what ? are you serious ? you 'd defect to our archrival ! ? _eos
_go keep your voice down . we 'll talk more later . right now i need to see vince . _eos
_go we definitely have to talk , zina . and watch your back . elvin is still mad about his nose . _eos
_go ok , but do n't tell anyone what i said . _eos
_go i 'm not going to buy one . _eos
_go you 're not ? _eos
_go i think it 's a waste of money . _eos
_go it actually costs less if you have a bus pass . _eos
_go how is that ? _eos
_go you can use it however many times you need to . _eos
_go is that right ? _eos
_go yup , and you can keep the money in your pocket . _eos
_go that sounds nice . _eos
_go you should go get yours . _eos
_go yeah , i think i will . _eos
_go yes , good morning . this is mr . suzuki from video tv . may i speak to mr . johnson ? _eos
_go i 'm sorry , but mr . johnson is out at the moment . can i take a message ? _eos
_go uh , yes , okay . tell him john suzuki called . that 's s - u - z - u - k - i . _eos
_go yes . _eos
_go from video tv . _eos
_go yes , video tv . _eos
_go tell him i telephoned . i 'd like to see him about the videotapes . can he call me this afternoon ? _eos
_go yes , of course . what 's your telephone number ? _eos
_go it 's , area code 413 , 447 - 9626 . _eos
_go that is 413 - 447 - 9662 ? _eos
_go no , that 's 447 - 9626 . _eos
_go oh , i 'm sorry , 447 - 9626 . _eos
_go yes , that 's right . extension 162 . _eos
_go extension 162 . okay , mr . suzuki . i 'll give him the message . _eos
_go thank you . good - bye . _eos
_go good - bye . _eos
_go sure . i usually have my lunch here . the food is tasty and they offer a big variety . _eos
_go let 's line up . the steak is very inviting . i 'll have it . _eos
_go i 'll have ham and egg with french fries . what dessert do you want ? _eos
_go banana pie . _eos
_go where shall we sit ? _eos
_go how about there ? _eos
_go i love it . i really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it . it gives me a real sense of satisfaction . do you enjoy cooking ? _eos
_go i do n't like it . it takes up too much time and i really hate having it clean up after the meal . i ca n't stand doing the washing up , drying up and putting all the dishes and cutlery away . _eos
_go you can ask the guests for help . my guests usually insist on doing the washing up . i just have to remind them where everything goes . _eos
_go so what kinds of dishes do you usually make ? i know you like italian food . _eos
_go italian , indian and chinese . i 've only recently started cooking chinese meals and i need some more practice . _eos
_go do you find it hard to get ingredients for chinese food ? _eos
_go not at all . you can find most of them in supermarkets . the ingredients are usually the same as in western food . the way that the food is prepared is the big difference , not the ingredients . _eos
_go how long does it take you to cook a meal for 5 or 6 people ? _eos
_go obviously , it depends on what i 'm cooking . but i 'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours . _eos
_go you came to the right place . any particular decade ? _eos
_go if you had a box made in the'20s , that would be nice . _eos
_go we just got one in yesterday , so now we have six . _eos
_go would any of them have dancing figures ? _eos
_go yes , we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures . _eos
_go oh , they 're both so beautiful . let me have this one , i think . _eos
_go that one truly is a beautiful piece of work , is n't it ? _eos
_go one last question _eos
_go oh , no . everything we sell here is " as is . " _eos
_go i guess i was asking for too much . _eos
_go if it breaks down , maybe you can find a repairman on the internet . _eos
_go why not ? come on ! just a cute little puppy . or a kitty ! _eos
_go who is going to look after a dog or a cat ? _eos
_go i will ! i 'll feed it , bathe it and walk it every day ! we can get a labrador or a german shepard ! _eos
_go what if we want to take a vacation ? who will we leave it with ? plus , our apartment is too small for that breed of dog . _eos
_go ok . how about we get a cat or a ferret ? _eos
_go we 're planning on having children soon , i do n't think those animals are a good idea with a baby in the house . _eos
_go fine ! let 's get a bird then ! we can keep it in its cage and teach it to talk ! a parrot would be awesome ! _eos
_go i 'll tell you what , i can get you some hamsters and we 'll take it from there . _eos
_go yay ! _eos
_go but i have n't used exercising equipment before . can you tell us some more details ? _eos
_go certainly . we have here the race apparatus , stationary bike , muscle builder set , chest expander , bar bell , dumb bell and so on . _eos
_go working in the gym is a very good way for losing weight . what else do you have ? _eos
_go here 's the swimming pool . it 's open from 10 a . m . to 11 p . m . there are also massage rooms here . _eos
_go that 's wonderful ! i like swimming . _eos
_go i 've already told my buddy , mark , that i am going hunting with him in alaska . _eos
_go you ca n't be serious ! _eos
_go hey , i 've always gone hunting or fishing on vacation . i am sorry that bothers you . _eos
_go after a year together , i thought it pretty safe to assume that we would automatically spend our vacation together . _eos
_go says who ? i do n't think that is necessarily the case . _eos
_go you know , now that i think about it , i really do n't have much more to say to you at all ! _eos
_go whatever you say ! _eos
_go not yet . i do n't know how to fill out the form . what is the tax - free allowance for supporting a dependent ? _eos
_go i do n't really know . why not ask the accountant or the lawyer of the law firm ? they will tell you which is subject or not subject to taxation . he can even help you avoid paying tax legally . _eos
_go if i do n't pay my taxes , would the tax officials discover it ? _eos
_go certainly . no one who evades tax can escape from their detection . they 'll check your income through computers . you 'd better make a declaration to the tax authorities as soon as possible . if you fail to meet the deadline , you will be fined . _eos
_go i quarreled with my roommate last night . he is really stubborn . _eos
_go calm down ! shouting wo n't help ? _eos
_go he is really outrageous . _eos
_go what happened ? _eos
_go i went back home last night . you know tired as a dog , so i took a quick shower and went to bed . i could n't fall asleep , because brian was there in the living room , playing his stupid stereo so loud . i kindly told him to turn that down a little bit . he shouted at me . _eos
_go what ? he ca n't do this to you . _eos
_go well , he did it anyway . then he came into my room and shot all his shit blah blah blah ... you know . _eos
_go what did you do ? _eos
_go i shouted it back of course . _eos
_go hold it , mike . you wo n't accomplish anything by hollering at him , right ? you worked it all up till now . why not wait until you cool down a bit ? _eos
_go what would you do if you were in my shoes ? _eos
_go just stay cool . you know . when you get back home tonight , tell him that you did n't mean to quarrel with him . _eos
_go no way , kate . i mean it 's just not my fault . _eos
_go i know . it would n't hurt much to say sorry first . and after that , you can casually mention the problem . i am sure he will cooperate . _eos
_go i am too angry to do that . _eos
_go let me see . i am sorry we just have sold it out . _eos
_go will you have it later ? _eos
_go i think so . could i have you name , telephone number ? if we get one , i will call you . _eos
_go that 's terrific . thank you . _eos
_go charles dickens . actually no one can parallel him in writing . _eos
_go i 'm afraid i ca n't agree with you on that . i like d . h . laurence 's novels better . _eos
_go i like board games . i like chinese chess and draughts . _eos
_go i 've never played chinese chess before , but i 've seen old men playing it in the street . it looks complicated . _eos
_go it 's about as complicated as chess . the basic rule and moves are simple enough , but there are many strategies that players need to learn . _eos
_go i like playing cards . i 'm pretty good at poker . do you play cards ? _eos
_go i 'm terrible at cards and so i never play games which involve gambling , like poker . if i did , i 'd lose all my money . _eos
_go do you play bridge ? _eos
_go yes , i do . it 's hard to find four players though , so i do n't play very often . do you know anyone who plays ? if so , we could set up a game . _eos
_go i can play quite well . i have a friend who likes playing , but she 's not very good at it . shall i invite her to play ? _eos
_go sure , i have a friend who play fairly well . we should find out when our friends are free and arrange a game . _eos
_go i 'll call my friend now . you call yours . _eos
_go sure . the coach leaves at 6:30 a . m . , in front of our office . the drive takes eight hours , with two stops to see some sights . _eos
_go what about the hotel accommodations ? _eos
_go you 'll be staying at holiday inn . it 's a three - star hotel with two restaurants and a swimming pool . _eos
_go great . what types of things will we do at lushun falls ? _eos
_go the second day you take a four - hour city tour . in the afternoon you go on the famous boat cruise under the falls . _eos
_go oh hello , sally . this is dave thomson here . could i speak to jim please ? _eos
_go i 'm afraid he 's not in at the moment dave . he went out about an hour ago and he 's not back yet . _eos
_go any idea when he might be back ? _eos
_go well , he should n't be long . he said he was just going to get some paint . but i would n't be surprised if he 's stopped off at the pub on the way back . _eos
_go ok . well , tell him i 've called , will you , and i 'll try again later . _eos
_go all right . goodbye , dave . _eos
_go thanks then sally . goodbye . _eos

_go sure that 's fine . here is the list of all the things you need to get . do n't forget anything ! and can you pick up a bottle of wine on your way home ? _eos
_go hey , honey i 'm back . wow , the house looks really good ! _eos
_go great ! can you set the table ? _eos
_go just a sec i 'm just gon na vacuum this rug real fast _eos
_go wait ! do n't turn it on ... _eos
_go i 'd like to talk to somebody about the group account deposit service . _eos
_go this refers to the deposit business offered to the level 1 account of group companies . _eos
_go what is it used for ? i mean , why bother to get this special account ? _eos
_go group companies can use this to make their arrangement of funds flexible , when dealing with their subsidiaries . _eos
_go i see , so this can really cut down on time and centralise management . interesting ... _eos
_go yes , sir . what can i do for you ? _eos
_go i want to buy some specialties . can you recommend me some ? _eos
_go sure . i strongly advise you to buy a bottle of perfume and a lighter . _eos

_go yes , i 've brought a list of your recent products with me . we 'd like to import some of your latest clothes for the second half of this year . we 're ready to place an order with you . _eos
_go great ! b , most of the items listed are available this year . i hope we can come to an agreement and sign the contracts , so as to enable our timely delivery . _eos
_go that sounds good . but i have a proposal now . _eos
_go what 's the proposal ? _eos
_go both of our two parties were involved in the discussion previously . shall we also allow some of our clients to join us ? _eos
_go good idea ! in this way , our clients'needs will be met and disagreements between the two parties avoided . _eos
_go sounds like we have the same idea . _eos
_go generally speaking , job seekers can enter the websites either of job agencies or of some units for job advertisements . _eos
_go how should i contact them ? _eos
_go you can e - mail your application materials for application to the websites of job agencies for enrollment in their database . _eos
_go can i get a quick reply from the sites ? _eos
_go yes , usually it takes a short time , but you have to await the choice of the units for a while . _eos

_go i 've been trying to get through to the booking office for the last ten minutes . but the line has been engaged all the time . why is it taking so long ? _eos
_go i 'm sorry to hear that . i 'm afraid it is often the case during the peak hours . shall i ask them to call you when the line is free ? _eos

_go you are welcome ! have a nice flight . _eos
_go i have worked as an executive secretary for 5 years , first for trading companies , and now i am working for a trust company . i interact well with peers , clients , administrators and bosses . i thrive on challenge and work well in high - stress environments . _eos
_go how are your typing and shorthand skills ? _eos
_go i can type 100 chinese words a minute and take dictation in english at 150 words a minute . _eos
_go can you operate computers skillfully ? _eos
_go yes , i can . i have received some special training in computers . besides i am good at operating common office machines , such as fax machines and duplicating machines . _eos
_go sometimes we are very busy and need to work overtime . how do you feel about that ? _eos
_go that 's all right . but could you tell me how often and how many hours i should work overtime ? _eos
_go it just depends . if we have important visiting delegations , you have to stay with us . it 's not unusual . _eos
_go mr . smith , i 's like to ask you a question . _eos
_go ok , please . _eos
_go what specific duties would i perform if i am hired ? _eos
_go nothing different from a secretary 's common responsibilities . however , you know , our company is an international trade - oriented company , can you handle english papers and write english correspondence ? _eos
_go yes . i specialized in english secretary studies at college and that 's one of the main parts of my present job . _eos
_go what are your salary expectations ? _eos
_go i really need more information about the job before we start to discuss salary . maybe you could tell me what is budgeted for the position . _eos

_go we 'll inform you of our final decision by early july . do you have any other questions ? _eos
_go no . thank you for the time . _eos
_go we have to equip our company with a network of work stations at every office and show room as soon as possible . _eos
_go i also realized this issue . and office automation is essential . _eos
_go besides , internet tends to be more essential now in the information age . _eos
_go good idea . a network of work stations is helpful for our management . _eos
_go and , to be frank , our copying machines are too slow ; our telephone system is limited in function . _eos
_go you are right . the current equipment of our offices really falls behind . next week , you can provide me a catalogue of new equipment . _eos
_go i need to book a plane ticket to london . _eos
_go round - trip or one - way ? _eos

_go do you think you are proficient in both written and spoken english ? _eos
_go yes , i think i am quite proficient in both written and spoken english . _eos
_go do you think you can make yourself understood in english with ease ? _eos
_go yes , i think i can in ordinary circumstances . _eos
_go do you think you can speak english quite fluently ? tell me about your english education . _eos
_go yes , i think i speak english quite fluently . i got a high score on toefl . i majored in english in college . _eos
_go thank you for noticing ! i 've been making a few lifestyle changes over the past year . _eos
_go tell me about it . i 'm interested . _eos
_go well , it all started when my brother challenged me to quit smoking . _eos
_go ha ! that 's right . you used to smoke . i forgot ! _eos
_go when i kicked that habit , i found i had so much more energy . i started exercising . _eos
_go at the gym ? _eos

_go thank you for saying so . have you seen the exhibition halls ? on display are most of our products , such as silk , woolen knitwear , cotton piece goods , and garments . _eos
_go oh , yes . i had a look yesterday . i found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design . the exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles . i 've gone over the catalogue and the pamphlets enclosed in your last letter . i 've got some idea of your exports . i 'm interested in your silk blouses . _eos
_go our silk is known for its good quality . it is one of our trade - trional exports . silk blouses are brightly colored and beau - fully designed . they 've met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand . _eos
_go sure . what do you need the most help with , the food or entertainment ? _eos
_go i need help with food . _eos
_go ok , well , let 's coordinate our efforts . should this party be formal or casual ? _eos
_go i think it should be casual . _eos
_go i agree . next , we have to decide on food . we have a choice of chinese or continental cuisine . which one should we have ? _eos
_go i would prefer chinese food for this party . _eos
_go perfect choice . for music , should we have a live band or a dj ? _eos
_go i think we should hire a live band . _eos
_go ok then . well , i will work on my part and get back to you with my progress on friday . _eos
_go no problem . now , do you prefer working with others or flying solo ? _eos
_go actually , i enjoy both . _eos
_go so , what is most important to you in a job ? do you need job security or professional growth and a chance to advance ? _eos
_go i need job security . _eos
_go would you be able to relocate ? _eos
_go i am open to relocating . _eos
_go what are your annual salary requirements ? _eos
_go i need at least 75,000 per year . _eos
_go i 'll keep that in mind . thank you for coming in today . we 'll be in touch . _eos
_go yes , it is . please put your luggage on this scale . _eos
_go ok . is the plane on schedule ? _eos
_go yes , it is . how many pieces of hand luggage do you have ? _eos
_go two . _eos
_go yes . come with me to the vitamin section . _eos
_go i knew there would be a few choices , but this selection is huge ! _eos
_go you 're looking for a multi though , right ? _eos
_go that 's right . just a simple multi - vitamin that i can take every day . _eos
_go okay . then i recommend this one . it 's made especially for men about your age . _eos
_go oh ! you took the guesswork right out of that one . _eos
_go that 's my job ! is there anything else i can assist you with ? _eos
_go okay . is your hair naturally curly or is it a perm ? _eos
_go it 's natural . my friend told me you know how to work with curls . _eos
_go that 's my specialty . let me put this around your neck . _eos
_go do you have any product that controls frizz ? _eos
_go with the cut i 'll give you , we will minimize a lot of that . _eos
_go thank you ! _eos
_go and when we 're done , i 'll show you some great stuff to take care of the rest . _eos
_go okay . say when . _eos
_go i 'm not in the mood . _eos
_go it 's the circus . _eos
_go i do n't want to sit there and watch them torturing the animals . _eos
_go oh , come on , they give them treat too . oh , look , that little monkey is so cute . _eos
_go cute ? hope so . _eos
_go oh , it is coming to us , come on , ben , get a banana to it . _eos
_go me ? no way , keep him away from me , please . _eos
_go why are you acting so strange today ? _eos
_go i 've said that i 've got a problem with the circus . i 'm not kidding . _eos
_go that 's weird ! _eos
_go all right , madam . when i was sales manager at the beijing friendship store . i succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 % and profit margins from 50 % to 80 % . _eos
_go that is quite an achievement ! do you consider it your most rewarding work experience ? _eos
_go i do n't think so . i 'll create further achievement in the future . _eos
_go have you received any honors ? _eos
_go yes . i got the title of " advance worker " in 2006 . _eos
_go do you have any publications ? _eos
_go yes . i wrote a thesis entitled " on interpersonal relations in the socialist market economy " and it was published in china daily . _eos
_go hi there , everyone . we hope you 're having a good night ! _eos
_go was n't that football game great ! i just knew we 'd win ! _eos
_go the night is young , folks . get some food and mingle with those faces from yesterday . _eos
_go later we 'll let you know who the king and queen of the reunion will be . _eos
_go but for now , the band is playing the songs from our senior year . get out on that dance floor ! _eos
_go yes . go to the next corner and turn left onto center street . walk three blocks to second avenue and turn right . walk two more blocks and you 'll see city hall on the left . _eos
_go i 'm sorry . i did n't follow you . could you please repeat that ? _eos
_go okay . first , go to the next corner and turn left onto center street . _eos
_go uh - huh . _eos
_go then , walk three blocks to second avenue an turn right . are you with me so far ? _eos
_go yes . i 'm following you . _eos
_go then , walk two more blocks an you 'll see city hall on the left . have you got all that ? _eos
_go yes . now i 've got it . thank you very much . _eos
_go nothing much , what 's going on ? _eos
_go i 'm having a party this friday . _eos
_go oh , really ? that 's nice . _eos
_go i wanted to see if you wanted to come . _eos
_go this friday ? sorry , i already have plans . _eos
_go doing what ? _eos
_go i 'm going to dinner with my family . _eos
_go i really wanted you to come , but i understand . _eos
_go yeah , maybe next time . _eos
_go i 'll hold you to that . _eos
_go sounds like a plan . _eos
_go it 's simple . you can use call transfer . _eos
_go is it so simple ? _eos
_go sure . you know , we spend most of our time at home or in the office every day , so i receive handset calls with the hand - free telephone , so i need pay little for receiving calls . _eos
_go it 's true . _eos
_go call transfer has many other advantages . when i am in places where network ca n't cover , such as the high building , i also use call transfer function , which transfers my calls to the hand - free telephone and i will not miss any call . _eos
_go that 's all ? _eos
_go in hospitals or on planes , handsets will interfere with some equip - ment , so we must close our handsets . if you set call transfer , the problem will be solved . _eos
_go tomorrow morning ? what about tomorrow afternoon ? _eos
_go then i 'll see you in the afternoon . _eos
_go ok . _eos
_go welcome . one of your duties is to know the number of the customer and accept reservation . _eos
_go what else do i need to do ? _eos
_go you inform the people in charge and let them reserve dinning tables for guests . _eos
_go you still have time on your lease . _eos
_go there 's no way that i can stay here . _eos
_go that 's not going to be all right . _eos
_go i do n't understand why . _eos
_go i 'm going to have to keep your deposit _eos
_go why ca n't i have it back ? _eos
_go because you 're leaving before your lease is over . _eos
_go you have to give it back to me . _eos
_go you 're not going to get it . _eos
_go but i 'm not able to live here anymore . _eos
_go i ca n't help you with that . _eos
_go here it is . 350 yuan all together . _eos
_go may son adores my new hairstyle so i suppose it is worth it . _eos
_go hearing you say that is a big reward for us . and here is the receipt . _eos
_go thank you . _eos
_go wait ! congratulations ! you are the lucky customer of our anniversary celebration . _eos
_go wow , it 's surprising . so what do i get ? _eos
_go you can have a free facial and then make up free for you . do you want it now ? _eos
_go probably not . doing that will probably take another three hours which i ca n't afford now . _eos
_go here is our number . call us when you are ready to come . _eos
_go you mean i should make an appointment ahead of time ? _eos
_go yes . _eos
_go got it . bye for now . _eos
_go i am sorry , but i ca n't lend it to you now , for i have n't finished reading it . if you do n't mind , i can lend you some back numbers to you . _eos
_go that would be very kind of you . by the way , is it a monthly magazine ? _eos
_go no , it is a fortnightly . so , you see , i can get the new one quite soon . _eos
_go yes , i do . i also use an anti - spyware program and a firewall . there are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users . you have to be very c _eos
_go how often do you run your anti - virus program ? _eos
_go i usually run it every few days . it finds a virus about half the time . _eos
_go which anti - virus program would you recommend ? _eos
_go have you tried this one ? it 's very good and you can download it for free on the internet . you can also download updates for free . _eos
_go that sounds very good . which website should i visit to download it ? _eos
_go just a minute ... go to this one . i 'll send you an email with the line in it . it only takes a few minutes to download . then you have to go through the set up procedures . but they are not complicated . _eos
_go what do you use your computer for ? _eos
_go i use it for several things - surfing the net , word processing and creating presentations . i do n't play many games on my computer , but i do a lot of work with photographs . using a computer program , you _eos
_go computers are great , are n't they ? i should download some programs and learn how to use them . _eos
_go b : : nice to meet you , mr . wilson . _eos
_go a : : tim , please . please be seated . _eos
_go b : : thank you . _eos
_go a : : so , wily , you have been with ibm for two years , ready for change ? _eos

_go take it easy . i 'll send a larger to pick you up . _eos
_go thank you very much . _eos
_go hello , becky . well , you see , i have this thing here , called a fixed deposit certificate , and i 've just noticed the date on it . _eos
_go oh , i see . you have two choices here you can either redeem or renew . _eos
_go i think i 'll redeem , if that 's not a problem . _eos
_go no problem at all , mr waterstone . any preference as to how you want the money ? _eos
_go anything you like , but not too many large notes . it 's useful to have smaller notes . _eos
_go here we go , mr waterstone . here 's your money and your interest note . _eos
_go yes , yes . everything 's fine . thank you very much , becky . _eos
_go i need to rent three pairs of skates for the morning . _eos
_go what sizes do you need ? _eos
_go one pair of 37 , and two pairs of 21 . one for me , and the other two for two kids . _eos
_go here you are . and here are three crash helmets . _eos
_go thanks . well , those two kids are beginners . what should i do about their safety ? _eos
_go well , there are a lot to do , but nothing to worry about . first , make sure they do n't go far from the railings . _eos
_go oh , yeah , maybe i should ask them just to walk along the railings . _eos
_go that 's a good idea . and remind them to be slow at the beginning , not to run into the railings . _eos
_go ok . anything else ? _eos
_go never go to the center of the lake . the ice there is too thin to skate on . _eos
_go got it . thanks for reminding me . and , are there any intensive training courses ? _eos
_go mike , you 're late again . _eos
_go i 'm sorry , but my sister was ill , so i _eos
_go do you think i believe the story like that ? _eos
_go but it 's true . _eos
_go how can believe it if the same excuse was used twice within a week ? _eos
_go that 's coincident . _eos
_go ok , hold it . remember to be punctual next time . _eos
_go i promise i will . _eos
_go you 'd better . _eos
_go something important ? _eos
_go yes . i have just booked two tickets . _eos

_go then it is june 20 the day after tomorrow . _eos
_go yes . think about it carefully . _eos
_go oh , come on . tell me please . why did you book tickets to paris ? _eos
_go oh , honey ! do n't you remember this important day to us ? _eos
_go sorry . _eos
_go it is our 10th wedding anniversary this june 20 . _eos
_go our 10th wedding anniversary ? _eos
_go of course . you completely forgot it . _eos
_go darling . i think you have made a mistake . _eos
_go i have made a mistake ? _eos
_go yes . we married on july 20 ten years ago . _eos
_go july 20 ? but i think it should be june 20 . _eos
_go yes . we had planned to marry on june 20 , but something happened , so we had to put off our wedding day . _eos
_go yes . i remember now . we put it off . i did make a mistake . but how shall we deal with the tickets ? _eos
_go since you have booked . then let 's celebrate our wedding anniversary before hand . _eos
_go no , thank you . check , please . _eos
_go wait a moment . i will calculate it for you . your bill comes to $ 36 . _eos
_go here are $ 40 . keep the change . that 's my tip for you . _eos
_go how to do it ? _eos
_go just pick up a tray , then put a knife , a fork , a spoon and a paper napkin on it and stand in the line . _eos
_go how long will it take to reach the buffet ? _eos
_go not long , because people rush for lunch . _eos
_go the line sure does move fast . _eos
_go tell the man behind the counter what you want . _eos
_go ok . i like that green vegetable but i do n't know how to call it . _eos
_go just point to it if you do n't know the name . _eos
_go all right . _eos
_go yeah , but i 'm still waiting for my invitation . _eos
_go oh really ? she gave me mine earlier today . _eos
_go well , she 'll probably just give me my invitation later on today . _eos
_go yeah , so are you planning on going ? _eos
_go i think so . it sounds like it 's going to be a lot of fun . _eos
_go it really does , i ca n't wait . _eos
_go what time does the party start ? _eos
_go it starts at 8 o'clock . _eos
_go oh , well , how many people has she given invites to so far ? _eos
_go i 'm not sure , but i do n't think she 's given out that many . _eos
_go well , hopefully she 'll give me my invite later on today . _eos
_go the outlook in the future is very positive . because we have been in this field for hundreds of years and we know how to survive this crisis safely . _eos
_go as the department i am applying for is expanding , i would like to contribute by effort . _eos
_go great . welcome to our company . _eos
_go can you please tell me where you are located ? _eos
_go sure , we are off singing road , close to the bank . _eos
_go thank you , i know where that is . _eos
_go hello , john . _eos
_go i 'm with hartford public relations . i 'd like to set up an appointment to come by and talk with you about our services . _eos
_go how about tomorrow at 11 o'clock ? _eos
_go oh , do n't mention it . it was terrible . _eos
_go what'the matter ? _eos
_go the food station was as crowded as usual . i waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when i finally got it the chicken was underdone . _eos
_go i see . you simply ca n't blame the server for this . _eos
_go yes , i know . fast food is so popular in this district . _eos
_go that 's true . _eos
_go anyway , how was your such , catherine ? _eos
_go it was good . i brought lunch from home today . _eos
_go you did ? i thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in america . _eos
_go well , i personally do n't like them because i do n't believe that they are healthy . _eos
_go i guess you 're right . more often than not , people go there only for convenience . the foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat . _eos
_go yes . i am wondering that you must believe fast food is our lifestyle , do n't you ? _eos
_go you bet . almost all top brands such as mcdonald 's and kfc are from america . _eos
_go well , actually two - thirds of americans may avoid these places . _eos
_go seriously ? _eos
_go yeah , it 's hard to believe but true . _eos
_go wow , that 's really interesting . so who won ? _eos
_go well , the great wall of china , the taj mahal in india . _eos
_go i 've been there ! it really is an amazing work of architecture and art . the entire complex is made of white marble and in the interior of the tomb , the walls are covered with gems and emeralds ! _eos
_go cool ! also amongst the winners is petra , in jordan , mach pitch in peru and the pyramid in chichenitza in mexico . _eos
_go wait a minute ! it also says that the christ re - deemer statue in brazil and the colosseum in rome are wonders . i would love to go to italy and see the colosseum , stand in the middle like a gladiator ! _eos
_go well , let 's see if we can find some cheap airfare and we can go towards the end of the year . _eos
_go good idea ! _eos
_go that should be no problem . may i have your full name , please ? _eos
_go my name is john sandals . _eos
_go hello , mr . sandals . my name is michelle . what days do you need that reservation , sir ? _eos
_go i 'm planning to visit new york from friday , april 14 until monday , april 17 . _eos
_go our room rates recently went up . is that okay with you , mr . sandals ? _eos
_go how much per night are we talking about ? _eos

_go that price is perfectly acceptable . _eos
_go wonderful ! do you prefer a smoking or nonsmoking room ? _eos
_go nonsmoking , please . _eos
_go next question , is a queen - size bed okay ? _eos
_go that sounds fine . _eos
_go okay , mr . sandals . your reservation is in our computer . all we need now is a phone number . _eos
_go certainly . my phone number is 626 - 555 - 1739 . _eos
_go thank you , mr . sandals . we look forward to seeing you in new york ! _eos
_go um yes . i 'd like a medium pizza with pepperoni , olives , and extra cheese . _eos
_go we have a two - for - one special on large pizzas . would you like a large pizza instead ? _eos
_go sure , that sounds good . _eos
_go great ! would you like your second pizza to be the same as the first ? _eos
_go no , make the second one with ham , pineapple and green peppers . oh , and make it thin crust . _eos
_go okay , thin crust . your total is $ 21 . 50 and yourorder will arrive in thirty minutes or it 's free ! _eos
_go perfect . thank you . bye .. _eos
_go wait ! ! i need your address ! _eos
_go hi there . i 'm calling about personal internet banking , what details can you give me ? _eos
_go personal internet banking is a self service financial service that is based on the internet . it can be used by both businesses and individuals . we offer an online payment service , personal net banking , which includes services such as account transfers , personal foreign exchange trading . you can also get account management services , online bill payment , for household bills like gas and electricity ... _eos
_go that sounds good . at the moment i spend ages queuing at the post office to pay my bills . _eos
_go it depends on the time of year . at peak times we hire in casual workers to help with packing and dispatch . we also contract out certain services all year round , for example , cleaning . we run a very tight operation ! _eos
_go do you handle the recruiting yourselves ? _eos
_go sometimes we use a local employment agency . it depends on the job . _eos
_go well i think i can afford that apartment . but are pets allowed ? _eos
_go hmm ... let me look . yes , it says it 's a pet - friendly building . _eos
_go that 's great . that means i can bring my cat , mr . twinkles . where is the apartment located ? _eos
_go it says it 's located in the suburbs . _eos
_go chicken , please . _eos
_go good choice ! _eos
_go what kind of drinks do you have ? _eos
_go well , we have all kinds of beverages in addition to fruit juices . _eos
_go in that case , let me have a glass of orange juice . _eos
_go anything else ? _eos
_go i would like to have some tea as well . _eos
_go another flight attendant is coming down the aisle with coffee and tea . _eos
_go i see . _eos
_go i 'd be glad to . _eos
_go i 'm afraid that i do n't have a credit history . i just came to this country . _eos
_go do you have an account with this bank ? _eos
_go i 'm afraid not . _eos
_go in that case i highly recommend you apply for a savings and checking account also . that would help with your credit card application . _eos
_go what is the interest rate on your card ? _eos
_go the annual charge rate is 9 . 5 % . _eos
_go that 's very expensive ! _eos
_go not really . the credit card is a revolving account . you only pay interest on what you owe . _eos
_go how does the bank bill its customers for credit card charges ? _eos
_go you will receive a monthly statement with each expenditure itemized . _eos
_go does the card provide any other benefits ? _eos
_go you can also get a cash advance up to 1,000 dollars on this card . _eos
_go well , i almost always get up very early , and i lift weights for an hour . _eos
_go you 're kidding ! _eos
_go no . and then i often go rollerblading . _eos
_go wow ! how often do you exercise like that ? _eos
_go about five times a week . what about you ? _eos
_go oh , i hardly ever exercise . i usually just watch tv in my free time . i guess i 'm a real couch potato ! _eos
_go no , i do n't think we have . _eos
_go my name is gao run . _eos
_go how do you do ? my name is james green . _eos
_go here 's my name card . _eos
_go and here 's mine . _eos
_go it 's nice to finally meet you . _eos
_go and i 'm glad to meet you , too . _eos
_go mr . smith , please . _eos
_go sorry , he is out . _eos
_go what time do you expect him back then ? _eos
_go sorry , i am not sure . can i take a message ? _eos
_go no , thanks . i will call back later . _eos
_go that 's fine . please call again later . _eos
_go ok . thank you . goodbye . _eos
_go yes , i need some traveler 's checks . _eos
_go how much do you need ? _eos
_go three thousand us dollars . _eos
_go all right , can i have your passbook ? _eos
_go yes , here you go . _eos
_go what amounts do you want the checks in ? _eos
_go it 's all the same to me . _eos
_go here you are . _eos
_go thanks . _eos
_go i need you to tell me what the problem is . _eos
_go the bathroom sink is stopped up . _eos
_go is the kitchen plumbing messed up also , or just the bathroom plumbing ? _eos
_go just the bathroom plumbing seems to have a problem . _eos
_go did this just start happening , or has it been going on for a while ? _eos
_go everything worked beautifully until a few hours ago . _eos
_go are you going to be home so i can come by and take a look at the problem ? _eos
_go i am not sure if i will be home later . _eos
_go i will be coming by around 10 this morning . if you are n't there , i 'll just use my key . _eos
_go it 's more violent than tv news ! _eos
_go what time is it anyway ? _eos
_go nine - thirty . _eos
_go oh , my god , three hours already ! i have to get the chores done ! _eos
_go no time . that 's their headlights in the window ! _eos
_go ok , emergency measures . let 's throw the dishes in the trash ! two birds with one stone ... _eos
_go little dude , your life is over ! _eos
_go no time to worry . we have to dispose of this evidence . _eos
_go he 's 21 . how old is james ? _eos
_go he 's a year older than keith , but he looks younger . _eos
_go how 's your father ? _eos
_go he 's fine . he retired last week . it 's a turning point in his life . now he can relax and enjoy his retirement . _eos
_go he can spend more time with his grandchildren . _eos
_go oh , i do n't think he wants to . he wants to travel to several different countries around the world . _eos
_go so , he wants to have a more active retirement . good idea ! _eos
_go how do you want to spend your old age ? _eos
_go in the same way , probably . _eos
_go sure , let me take a look ... personal information , education , experience , training ... i think you should add another section for language . you speak three languages , so you might as well put that on your resume . _eos
_go but languages do n't have anything to do with engineering . should n't everything i put on my resume have something to do with my field ? _eos
_go not necessarily . i think people would be impressed by your language abilities . it says something about your level of intellect and experience . also , i think human resources directors want to see more of a well - rounded person in a resume . _eos
_go it 's just a piece of paper , you think that they can tell if i am a well - rounded person by looking at it ? _eos
_go well , you 're right , the resume is limited in how much it can tell someone about a person . that 's why job interviews are important to let people know the real you that they ca n't see from a piece of paper . but resumes can be helpful in explaining things and giving a good impression to a potential employer . _eos
_go i need to think it over . _eos
_go tell me what you need . _eos
_go all right . i 'm prepared to , if the pay is reasonable . _eos
_go what a beautiful view we have here . _eos
_go yes , you can have a bird's - eye view of the whole city . _eos
_go wonderful . will we have any free time there ? _eos
_go of course . we will stay there for half an hour and you can do your own business . _eos
_go i just stayed at home and watched tv . _eos
_go did you watch the barcelona versus madrid game ? _eos
_go yes , it was a very evenly matched game . _eos
_go what were the results of the game ? _eos
_go it ended in a tie . _eos
_go what was the actual score ? _eos
_go it was three all . _eos
_go really ? i thought barcelona was going to win . they are a much better team than madrid . _eos
_go if barcelona had played as they normally do , they should have won . _eos
_go what happened ? _eos
_go their goalkeepers got injured after the first goal , but he kept on playing anyway . _eos
_go that explains it . _eos
_go how many more games are left this season ? _eos
_go that was the last game before the playoffs . _eos
_go when do the playoffs start ? _eos
_go in a few weeks . are you planning on watching them ? _eos
_go of course ! i really love watching football games on tv . _eos
_go me , too ! do you want to come over and watch the next game at my place ? i 'm planning on having a few people over to watch it together . _eos
_go sure , that would be great . _eos
_go ok , it 's a date then ! _eos
_go i 'm fine , thanks . just trying to get adjusted . it 's hard to keep track of everything around here . _eos
_go that 's for sure . you 're new , too , huh ? _eos
_go yeah . i just got here a couple of days ago . how about you ? _eos
_go gave me the receipt , please . _eos
_go here is my receipt . _eos
_go what 's wrong with it ? _eos
_go it 's too small for me to wear . _eos
_go would you like another bigger one ? _eos
_go no thanks . i want to have a refund . _eos
_go ok , here is your money . _eos
_go what is your favorite color , miss ? _eos
_go red . _eos
_go here you are . it 's very attractive . _eos
_go may i try it on ? _eos
_go go ahead . _eos
_go is there a mirror around here ? _eos
_go right over there . _eos
_go does it suit me ? _eos
_go yes , you look very nice . _eos
_go how much is it ? _eos
_go we 're having a clearance sale . $ 4 plus tax . _eos
_go that 's quite reasonable . _eos
_go may i ask you something ? _eos
_go what 's your question ? _eos
_go how many hours behind the wheel do i need ? _eos
_go what do you need to take it for ? _eos
_go i 'm trying to get my license . _eos
_go you need six hours . _eos
_go can i do all six hours in one day ? _eos
_go you have to do it in three days . _eos
_go that 's all i have to do ? _eos
_go that 's everything . _eos
_go well , that 's a relief . _eos
_go yes ? i 'll be very glad if i could be of any help to you . _eos
_go an hour ago , i bought this vase with my tourist . _eos
_go oh , yes . i remember it clearly . is there anything wrong with it ? _eos
_go i 'm afraid so . we found this crack on the bottom when i went back to my hotel . _eos
_go oh , how awful ! let me have a look , i 'm terribly sorry . it was most thoughtless of me . would you excuse me , please ? _eos
_go oh , it 's quite all right , i suppose . it ca n't be helped sometimes . _eos
_go it 's very kind of you to say so . how about changing another one for you ? _eos
_go all right . thank you . _eos
_go just a minute , please . i wo n't be long . i 'm sure this one is perfect . you may examine it carefully . _eos
_go oh , yes , it is . i 'll take this one . _eos
_go i 'm very sorry for any inconvenience i 've caused you . _eos
_go well , there 's no reason to apologize for such a trifle thing . _eos
_go sorry . i was too worried . _eos
_go i firmly believe that you love your brother very much . _eos
_go absolutely . by the way , do you sell any traditional chinese medicine ? _eos
_go yes , we have some chinese medicine for common cold . _eos
_go i heard chinese medicine has a better lasting effect in cure . _eos
_go it depends . it 's true that you can take some for prevention . _eos
_go it should be close to the university . neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is , the later we can get up . _eos
_go absolutely . that 's the most important thing to take into consideration . i 'm not too worried about the size of the flat . _eos
_go neither am i . so a small place is ok , but we 'll get a bigger one if it 's not expensive . do you mind if it 's in a noisy area ? _eos
_go i do n't mind . i 'm not a light sleeper , but quieter is better for when we have to study at home . _eos
_go good point . ok , let 's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us . _eos
_go yes , if we 're lucky we 'll find something in the next few days . i think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early . _eos
_go how much do you think the rent will be ? _eos
_go i asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month . _eos
_go which tooth is it ? _eos
_go this one here . _eos
_go ar , yes . there 's a big cavity . _eos
_go can you fill it ? _eos
_go i 'm afraid not . the tooth is too far gone . it 'll have to be taken out . _eos
_go then i might as well have it done now . _eos
_go you 'd better wait , the gums are swollen . take the medicine i prescribe and come back in three days . _eos
_go of course . it 's the best one i have here --- and it 's only 300 yuan . _eos
_go oh , it 's really nice , but to tell the truth , that 's far too expensive . _eos
_go really ? even for such an excellent one ? _eos
_go the local newspaper has ads for housing . _eos
_go is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with ? _eos
_go sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate . _eos
_go what do landlords charge for rent ? _eos
_go would you like an apartment for just yourself , or do you need it for two people ? _eos
_go there are two of us , but we only need a one - bedroom apartment . _eos
_go you should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month . _eos
_go i really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me . _eos
_go sure , i 'll go look at apartments with you anytime you want . _eos
_go with pleasure . _eos
_go i appreciate the building so much . i am wondering if you could take a picture of me against the building . _eos
_go no problem . _eos
_go unfortunately , it 's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford . _eos
_go why is the price so high ? _eos
_go it 's not just that the price is high , it 's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly . _eos
_go model of computers are n't compatible ? _eos
_go most current computer systems simply ca n't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities . _eos
_go maybe after the next generation of technology comes out , the price of this model will become more affordable . _eos
_go but by then , the technology will be outdated . _eos
_go true , but our focus has never been affordability anyway . coastwise , we may not be very competitive , but qualitywise , we definitely have an edge . _eos
_go that 's right , no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable . _eos
_go this model has advanced technoledge , superior components , it is compact , and it 's a top - quality product . _eos
_go i guess you get what you pay for . _eos
_go what kinds do you have ? _eos
_go oh , yeah , it 's quite of variety . regular , cold perm , straight perm , pink curl and form . _eos
_go last time i tried a pink curl perm and form permanent . set the wave a little loose than as usual , please . _eos
_go i 'm sorry , sir . i 'm not sure i understand . _eos
_go i 'm talking about the free stuff , like soap and shampoo . _eos
_go oh , i see . so , you 're saying that you 've already run out of your amenities . _eos
_go no , no . i 've got plenty left . _eos
_go now i 'm confused again ! what is the problem ? _eos
_go what am i going to do about souvenirs ? _eos
_go oh , i get it ! you want souvenirs ! _eos
_go yes , i 've got enough soap for my use , but no extra soap for souvenirs . _eos
_go sir , our souvenir shop carries all those items , and as a guest you get a discount . _eos
_go please ! free souvenirs are the only true souvenirs . _eos
_go i understand completely , sir . housekeeping will bring you souvenirs in just a moment . _eos
_go well , you can take the no . 36 bus from here , but then you have to walk about 30 minutes . _eos
_go that does n't sound too bad . _eos
_go actually , if you go to the bus stop in the next block , you can take bus 301 which will let you right off in front of the zoo . _eos
_go maybe that 's what i 'll do . thanks a lot . _eos
_go you 're welcome . _eos
_go what 'd you like , madam ? _eos
_go two muffins and a cup of coffee . will it take long ? _eos
_go no , just a few minutes . _eos
_go i 'm doing well . _eos
_go how may i help you ? _eos
_go could you cancel a check for me ? _eos
_go what 's the problem ? _eos
_go i wrote the check out for way too much . _eos
_go how much ? _eos
_go i wrote the check out for $ 150 . _eos
_go what were you supposed to write it out for ? _eos
_go i was supposed to write the check out for $ 100 . _eos
_go i 'll just cancel it for you right now . _eos
_go that 's great . you 're a lifesaver . _eos
_go yes . thank you . _eos
_go would you care for a drink before you order ? _eos
_go a glass of qingdao beer . _eos
_go yes , sir . i 'll bring it over . have you decided what you 'd like , sir ? _eos
_go will you make some recommendation ? _eos
_go yes , madam . the reporting desk for the british airway 's flight to london is over there . _eos
_go thank you so much . is this the desk for ba flight 123 to london ? _eos
_go yes , this is the right desk . have you any luggage ? _eos
_go the suitcase , that 's all . except my handbag . of course . _eos
_go would you please put you suitcase on the scales ? you need n't weigh your handbag . _eos
_go is there a receipt ? _eos
_go yes . i 'll attach your baggage receipt to your ticket . _eos
_go what must i do next ? _eos
_go you must go to immigration to the departure lounge . _eos
_go but i 'm not sleepy , mum . can i stay and watch more tv ? _eos
_go it 's already half past eleven . you have school tomorrow . you 'll sleepy all tomorrow , if you do n't sleep well tonight . _eos
_go i know . but i promise i wo n't be sleepy tomorrow . i work really hard . _eos
_go do n't you have the exams coming up soon ? i 'm sure you could spend more time preparing for those . _eos
_go oh , i nearly forgot the exams . _eos
_go you do well in maths , but your history is not good enough . am i right ? _eos
_go yeah , i guess so . maybe i can go to sleep now and get up early to review the lessons tomorrow . _eos
_go an excellent idea . work now and play later . _eos
_go i know you 're right . school is more important than tv . can i watch one more show , then go to bed . _eos
_go no , now it 's bedtime . _eos
_go oh , yes , please . but you are just closing , are n't you ? _eos
_go well , yes , we are , madam . the shop shuts down in five minutes . _eos
_go i shall not keep you long then . it was about some saucepans you had in your window last week . _eos
_go last week , madam ? i really ca n't remember which ones you mean . what were they like ? _eos
_go oh , they were lovely . sort of imitation wood , dark brown color , country - style you know , and the lids , if i remember rightly , they had a sort of leaf pattern , or was it flowers ? _eos
_go that 's strange . i do n't recognize any of the ones we had from that description . are you sure they were in this shop ? _eos
_go oh , you must know the ones i mean . they were on sale , a real bargain . reduced to a quarter of the original price . i could n't believe my eyes when i saw them . _eos
_go i am afraid the sales are over now , madam . and you know we all sold out of the saucepans . _eos
_go i do n't think you did , you know . my neighbor told me she saw some here only yesterday . _eos
_go well , it 's all new stock in the window now . _eos
_go may i just have a look , to see if there is anything else ? _eos
_go eh , well , madam , as you know we are closing . _eos
_go yes , yes , i am sorry i wo n't keep you . it must get on your nerves when customers come in right at closing time . but they were such beautiful saucepans . i 'd have bought them if i had made up my mind on the spot . _eos
_go perhaps madam , if you come back tomorrow , i could show you the whole range of kitchen ware . and there are still one or two things at the sale price . _eos
_go oh , look ! that was the one there . that is the sort of thing i was looking for . but it 's not quite the color . _eos
_go that might be the artificial lighting , madam . of course , if you could come back in daylight , you might find it 's exactly what you are looking for . _eos
_go there it is . that is the pattern ! the set behind you . thank goodness , they have n't been sold . and thank you so much for being so patient with me . yes , those are the ones . _eos
_go we have the offer ready for you . let me check . 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box , at 20,000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box , at 30,000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box , at 7 , 500 yuan , for shipment in june . the offer is valid for five days . _eos
_go i can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected . _eos
_go you know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years . the prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where . _eos
_go i am afraid i ca n't agree with you there . i must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we 've received from other companies . _eos
_go but you must take the design and quality into consideration . you know we are superior to others in design and quality . we have various styles , which the other companies can not catch up with . _eos
_go i agree that yours are of the top . _eos
_go well , since your order is large enough , can you give me a rough idea ? _eos
_go to have this business concluded , i should say a reduction of least 10 % would help . _eos
_go impossible . how about 5 % off ? _eos
_go right . a reduction of 5 % is acceptable . _eos
_go four is an unlucky number here , peter . four sounds like death in chinese . hotels often have no fourth floor . _eos
_go i see . oh , i know what i wanted to ask . how much should i tip this guy ? _eos
_go people do n't usually tip here , but you can . fifty dollars should be more enough . _eos
_go i 'd like to make a reservation for my trip from detroit to beijing on april 13 on trans pacific airline . _eos
_go do you want a single ticket or a round trip ticket ? _eos
_go i 'd like to have a round trip ticket with a one - year open return . _eos
_go economy or business class ? _eos
_go economy , please . how much is it ? _eos
_go it will be $ 850 . _eos
_go very good . could i get an electronic ticket ? i 'm always afraid of losing my tickets . _eos
_go no problem . how do you wish to pay for it ? _eos
_go bank of american card . the number is 6786 9182 12300 8657 . _eos
_go thank you ! would you like an aisle seat or a window seat ? _eos
_go an aisle seat , please . i 'm tall and need to get up and walk pretty often . _eos
_go no problem . your ticket is for trans pacific flight 87 from detroit to beijing at 3 forty p . m . on april 13 . you will arrive at beijing international airport at six 35 p . m . on april 14 . your electronic _eos
_go what time should i arrive at detroit airport ? _eos
_go please be at the airport two hours before your departure to check in . you also need to reconfirm your reservation with the airline at least 7 days prior to your departure . _eos
_go what happens if i ca n't leave on april 13 ? can i cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date ? _eos
_go yes , you can , but you will have to pay a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation . _eos
_go that 's ok . what are the weight restrictions for checked baggage ? _eos
_go on trans pacific international flights , each ticketed passenger is permitted a maximum of two checked bags with a maximum weight per checked bag of 70 pounds . _eos
_go that 's great ! i can have two bags checked for 70 pounds each . i think i 'm all set . you 're really efficient . thank you very much for your help . _eos
_go thank you for the compliment and for calling g . o . t . travel agency . have a nice trip ! _eos
_go well , i 'll be glad to help you out . i can come out anytime on tuesday or thursday of next week . _eos
_go let 's put it down for 1:15 on thursday . we 'll definitely need some new filing cabinets and at least one desk unit . _eos
_go fine . i 'll bring both our office furniture and equipment catalogues on thursday . _eos
_go thank you . but it is too bright for me . _eos
_go how about this brown one ? _eos
_go let me try it on . i like that color . _eos
_go ok , i will get one for your . here you are . _eos
_go but it is too loose . do you have the smaller size ? _eos
_go sorry , it had been sold out . _eos
_go what a pity ! _eos
_go how much would you like to borrow ? _eos
_go a thousand dollars . _eos
_go let me check with a credit manager . a record show your credit reading is quite high . i do n't think you have any problems . _eos
_go what 's the current interest rate ? _eos
_go our monthly interest is 1 . 5 % of the outstanding balance . would you please fill out the application the form ? _eos
_go when you flip the tie up , he 's right side up . brilliant . _eos
_go my dad will love this . he 's a dilbert fan . _eos
_go i would n't mind having one myself ... _eos
_go model it for me . _eos
_go ok ! _eos
_go wow ! you look just as dorky as dilbert ! _eos
_go i hope you can give me some advice . i 'm sick and tired of coming here or to the post office to pay my utility bills . it 's such a long way from my home , but i checked and you are my nearest branch . is there anyway i can do it from home ? _eos
_go that 's terrible . unfortunately , we do n't have that many branches outside the centre of town . what i 'd advise you to do is set up a direct debit service . _eos
_go a direct debit service ? what 's that exactly ? _eos
_go a direct debit means that every month we can arrange for all of your utility bills to come directly out of your account , no fuss , no hassle . _eos
_go but how will you know how much i should pay ? i mean , i receive my bills , not you . _eos
_go we set up an agreement with the , say , phone company . they tell us how much to pay them every month and we pay directly from your account . of course , we are able to do this with all of the utilities companies . _eos
_go i see . so , that would mean that every month it would just come from my account ? that does sound like a good idea , totally trouble free . _eos
_go hi . it 's tony calling from the dentist 's office . is lily there ? _eos
_go no , lily is not here at the moment . _eos
_go could you ask her to call me back when she gets in ? _eos
_go sure . what 's your number , please . _eos
_go 519 367 8901 . _eos
_go thanks . and your name is tony , right ? _eos
_go yes . i 'm tony . thank you very much . _eos
_go you 're welcome . bye . _eos
_go bye . _eos
_go i think it 's great ! i really like the color , and it goes really well with your eyes . i 've actually been eyeing that dress at maxine 's for a while now , but i was n't sure i could afford ninety - five dollars for a dress at the moment . _eos
_go um , ninety - five dollars ? _eos
_go yes , that 's the price they were advertising it at . i was hoping it might go on sale soon . why , how much did you pay for it ? _eos
_go i bought it for one hundred and forty - five dollars at helen 's boutique . i did n't know i could get it cheaper somewhere else . _eos
_go of course ! everything at helen 's is overpriced , and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store ! why did n't you shop around ? _eos
_go i do n't know , i just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much i wanted it . i guess i was too impulsive . _eos
_go i did . why ? _eos
_go did n't you know dogs should n't eat cooked chicken bones because they 're bad for their stomachs ? _eos
_go no , i did n't . i 'm sorry . it wo n't happen again . _eos
_go no , i do n't suppose he 's to blame . the man in the other car made a mistake . _eos
_go but he 's equally responsible because he tried to overtake you . _eos
_go how to adjust ? _eos
_go exporters must ensure that their product satisfies customers'needs , wants and likes . _eos
_go ah , some products are successful at home , but not be popular overseas . _eos
_go that 's because the fashion , taste and social customs and so on vary considerably . _eos
_go yes , sometimes the differences are great . _eos
_go well , we should be in accordance with national conditions and adjust the product . _eos
_go we have to ensure that the product should be attractive to guarantee sales . _eos
_go watch your language . _eos
_go $ 10 per person . _eos
_go here are $ 30 . by the way , where can i find a guide ? _eos
_go turn to the next window and they will help you find one . _eos
_go thanks a lot . _eos
_go where are you heading now ? _eos
_go i want to go back to my college on the huanghe road . it is very close to your house . _eos
_go is that the university next to the teachers'college ? _eos
_go that 's the one . _eos
_go you mean we 'll share the taxi ? _eos
_go yeah . if we share the cab , it 'll be cheaper . besides that your chinese is better than mine . the drivers usually have difficulty understanding me even though i practice my pronunciation carefully . _eos
_go well . do n't worry about it , i will be happy to share the taxi with you . _eos
_go my name is liu lichi . how do you do ? _eos
_go how do you do ? please be seated , how is your trip here ? _eos
_go quite good , i think . i came here by bus , and it took me about 15 minutes . _eos
_go oh , yes . how old are you ? _eos
_go twenty . _eos
_go hum , still a student ? _eos
_go yes , i 'm student of grade 3 in the university majoring in economics . _eos
_go what subjects are you studying ? _eos
_go english , math , commercial and legal studies , and accountancy . _eos
_go have you had any working experience . _eos
_go well , i worked at a supermarket during last summer holidays . _eos
_go what do you like to do in your spare time ? _eos
_go i like sports very much . besides that , i also like working on a computer in my spare time . _eos
_go how are your english and computer skills ? _eos
_go i have passed the cet - 4 and 6 . as far as computer is concerned i can use the computer for word processing . _eos
_go okay . mr . liu , we 'll inform you of the results within a week . _eos
_go it 's too loud . _eos
_go we 've been looking around for many hours . what on earth are you looking for ? _eos
_go well , you know , those styles or colors do n't suit me . _eos
_go what style do you want ? _eos
_go i want to buy a v - neck checked sweater , and it should be tight . _eos
_go oh , i see . how about the color ? _eos
_go quiet color . _eos
_go i know a shop selling this kind of sweaters . _eos
_go really ? let 's go there . _eos
_go sure ! what do you feel like having ? _eos
_go i really feel like having a big juicy steak ! _eos
_go oh . ok . i do n't eat meat , but that 's fine , i am sure wherever we are going they will have other options right ? _eos
_go i did n't know you were a vegetarian ! _eos
_go i 'm not , i am a vegan . _eos
_go a what ? _eos
_go a vegan . i do n't eat or use any animal based products . i do n't wear leather , eat eggs , drink milk or anything that comes from an animal . i used to be a pescatarian before , which basically means you do n't eat meat , but still have fish and seafood . _eos
_go wow ! that 's interesting ! it must be tough ! _eos
_go it 's a bit difficult to find vegetarian friendly restaurants sometimes , but since more and more people are vegetarians or vegans nowadays , it 's getting a bit less difficult . _eos
_go it was n't all that great . _eos
_go what did you dislike the most ? _eos
_go i do n't think that they had their act together . they did n't seem well prepared . _eos
_go did you think that the food was any good ? _eos
_go i was n't all that impressed by the food . _eos
_go the service certainly could have been better . _eos
_go the service did not help the situation . _eos
_go is this a restaurant that you want to come back to ? _eos
_go i am not interested in trying this restaurant again . _eos
_go no . i am a transit passenger going to sweden . _eos
_go how long are you going to stay here ? _eos
_go only one night . _eos
_go do you have any dutiable items ? _eos
_go no , i do n't . _eos
_go what are these ? _eos
_go they are my personal effects . _eos
_go first of all , we need to understand what i was looking for . do you know what the purpose of an inspection is ? _eos
_go i am not sure what a home inspection is all about . _eos
_go i went there to check for problems with the home , so you are n't surprised when you move in . _eos
_go would n't the owners have told me about any problems ? _eos
_go sellers are n't always truthful , and there might also be problems that they are n't aware of . _eos
_go can i require the owners to fix the problems ? _eos
_go you can make the sale of the house contingent on them fixing the problems . _eos
_go what did you find out when you did the inspection of my new home ? _eos
_go there were no major problems . one leaky pipe under the sink and two broken roof tiles was all that i found . _eos
_go i will take a rain check . _eos
_go tell me what seems to be the problem . _eos
_go my roommate always brings a lot of friends from off - campus . they stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while i have no place for study . i even do n't have the quietness to sleep . _eos
_go did you ever talk to him about it ? _eos
_go i have a question . _eos
_go what do you need to know ? _eos
_go i need to take the driver 's course . how many hours do i need ? _eos
_go it depends on what you 're trying to do with the completion of the course . _eos
_go i need to get my license . _eos
_go you 're going to need to complete six hours . _eos
_go how many hours a day can i do ? _eos
_go you can do two hours a day for three days . _eos
_go that 's all i need to do to finish ? _eos
_go yes , that 's all you need to do . _eos
_go thanks . i 'll get back to you . _eos
_go yes , please . _eos
_go ok . i 'll get the bellman to taka them up . which bags are yours ? _eos
_go my luggage is in the corner over there . they are the leather suitcase , the canvass holdall and the blue backpack . _eos
_go ok . _eos
_go please be careful with the suitcase , it 's very heavy . _eos
_go i 'll let the bellboy know . do n't worry , he 's very strong . _eos
_go and the holdall has some fragile items inside , so please be careful with that too . _eos
_go of course . _eos
_go about 50 miles . _eos
_go the traffic is not very heavy on this high way , is it ? so i 'm sure we 'll make it . _eos
_go no , but we 've got a hurry . it will be the rush hour soon . _eos
_go do n't worry . there 's plenty of time yet . _eos
_go but it 's friday today . this road is always jam packed during the weekend , is n't it ? _eos
_go right . _eos
_go wow ! it 's a fruit sculpture ! your chef is a real artist ! _eos
_go actually , uh , i made it myself ... _eos
_go you did ? wow ! where did you learn ... _eos
_go sorry , but i 've got ta run . enjoy your food , and ring the service button if you need anything else ! _eos
_go with the fifty forwards he sent out today , maybe we 'll inadvertently get inspired . _eos
_go i guess this is a good excuse to surf the net on someone else 's dime . _eos
_go who 'd have thought bean would be this kind of e - mail fanatic ? _eos
_go he must have just got online for the first time last week . he still thinks it 's some kind of new toy . _eos
_go i 'm happy with that price . _eos
_go let 's shake on it . _eos
_go okay , let 's shake on it . _eos
_go give me a big mac , a small order of french fries and a medium coke . _eos
_go you 'll need to wait a few minutes for the fries . they are still in the fryer . _eos
_go that 's fine . _eos
_go your total comes to $ 7 . _eos
_go here 's a twenty . could you give me some more napkins ? _eos
_go sure . your cash back is $ 13 . and we 'll bring out your fries in two minutes . _eos
_go thanks . _eos
_go miao ping , in your opinion , should we go for the type a or type b account ? _eos
_go well , the type b account is very restricted . if your aim is to use the account the same way as your use your settlement account , i would recommend the type a account for you . _eos
_go thanks for your time . i 'll go and discuss everything with my partner and i 'll be back later . _eos
_go i 've got a really bad headache and my stomach hurts . _eos
_go it sounds like you 're coming down with something . _eos
_go i 'll see what i have . what do you need it for ? _eos
_go i want to get cigarettes . _eos
_go you can use quarters , dimes and nickels . _eos
_go may i see your ticket please ? _eos
_go here you are . do you need to see my passport ? _eos
_go any form of picture i . d . will do . _eos
_go mmmm ... a photo i . d . i have my new jersey driver 's license . is that ok ? _eos
_go that will do . what an interesting picture ! how old is it ? _eos
_go actually it wad taken just last year , but i had a shaved head and a beard . can you still recognize me ? _eos
_go barely . will you be checking any luggage today ? _eos
_go yes , one suitcase . i also have a carry - on bag . _eos
_go ok . mr . lee , you 're all set . your flight leaves from gate 10 . boarding begins at 10:30 _eos
_go i graduated from peking university . _eos
_go what was your major at university ? _eos
_go i studied economics , i am especially interested in the economic development of china . _eos
_go what course did you like best ? _eos
_go i like business management , and i think it 's very useful for the present work . _eos
_go what do you think is the relationship between the subjects you 've taken and the job you are seeking ? _eos
_go i 've taken courses on office administration , reports and correspondence writing . i think all these are closely related to the job of assistant manager , because it requires the ability to perform general office work and to assist the manager in handling all paperwork . _eos
_go we 'd better not move him . i 'll get the first - aider . _eos
_go quite often . it is very convenient , saving me a lot of time . _eos
_go do you have some experiences to share with me ? i want to have a try . _eos
_go you are asking the right person . here are two very important tips . first , you need to visit no more than one site to find the best products and prices . i can recommend you some online merchants . second , write your mail address correctly . otherwise , you ca n't receive your delivery in time . _eos
_go what about the registration procedure ? is that complicated ? _eos
_go not at all . you just need to provide your name , address , e - mail address , phone number and bank or credit card information . i will help you with that . _eos
_go it is so nice of you . _eos
_go yeah , you know what ? i 've been going to the club regularly . the training really pays off . now i am in a good shape and i know more about how to keep fit . _eos
_go really ? tell me about it . i have n't gone to the club for a long time . i am too busy with work . _eos
_go it 's important to do proper exercises . _eos
_go you 're right . too much or too little wo n't do any good . _eos
_go the trainer tells me , besides regular sports activities , i should also have a healthy and balanced diet . _eos
_go sounds reasonable . _eos
_go we should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic . _eos
_go and fruits ! _eos
_go surely it is . getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness . _eos
_go i 've heard that . does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit ? _eos
_go yeah , he advises me to stay in a good mood . that can also help one to keep sound physical health . _eos
_go i think if you follow your trainer 's advice , you 'll be on the right track . _eos
_go you bet it ! _eos
_go generally speaking , we provide bikes for both gentlemen and ladies , size 19 , 21 , 23 , 25 and 27 inches . we can vary the colors according to the buyer 's requirements . here are the catalogues and the pattern books . they will give you a rough idea about our products . _eos
_go i am interested in your flying pigeon bicycles . i think some of these items will find a ready market in canada . but what our customers appreciate most is a reliable product . _eos
_go to be reliable is the strong point of our products . as a matter of fact , it 's always our practice to supply high quality goods at reasonable prices . flying pigeon is the best of its kind at the price . _eos
_go then i 'd like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales , such as mode of payment , delivery , discounts , etc . _eos
_go well , you know , the traffic in beijing is sometimes dangerous . therefore , i have to remind you of something . first , you should obey the traffic rules , do n't break in the red light . second , do n't play a joke with your friends when riding on the bike . third , do not hurry up when riding , or would make an accident . finally , remember come on the left and go on the right ! _eos
_go oh , my dear sister , i am no longer a baby ! _eos
_go thank you . but a number of things have been going wrong lately . _eos
_go that 's too bad . what problems are you having . _eos
_go oh , the whole house needs re - painting for starters . the carpet in the living room is worn out , and i 'd like to put in new wall - to - wall carpeting . last week , i had to call the plumber to fix the toilet . anyway , all par for the course when you own a house , i guess . i think i am going to hire an interior decorator to look the place over . _eos
_go i 've studied home decoration as a hobby . could i make some suggestions ? _eos
_go go right ahead . _eos
_go well , i think a crystal chandelier would look great in your living room , and maybe some new drapes for the windows . also , a grandfather clock would look great in the den . perhaps you could buy some potted plants for the dining room _eos
_go wow , you really do have a talent for this , alice . thanks for the suggestions . _eos
_go you are welcome , jack . glad to be of help . _eos
_go nice to see you with us , anne . please make yourself at home . _eos
_go thank you . you 're so considerate . _eos
_go there are different types . which one do you like best ? _eos
_go i think the red one fits me well . can i try it on ? _eos
_go surely , of course . _eos
_go where is the fitting room ? _eos
_go it 's there , near the mirror . _eos
_go do n't worry . you 'll be fine . first of all , put on your seat belt . adjust the mirrors . _eos
_go you do n't think i 'll need the seat belt , do you ? _eos
_go of course not . but it 's a good habit to put it on every time you drive . _eos
_go just in case , right ? _eos
_go right . hold the steering wheel with your hands at ten o'clock and two o'clock . _eos
_go i 'm going to england by flight be987 . _eos
_go when is your flight ? _eos
_go 10:00 am . when am i supposed to check in ? _eos

_go i 'm a little nervous . i 've never flown before . _eos
_go there 's nothing at all to worry about . once you are in the air , it 's just like sitting at your sitting room . it 's going to be a very pleasant flight . _eos
_go yes , please . _eos
_go will this table be all right ? _eos
_go actually , i 'd like a booth by the window if that 's possible . _eos
_go certainly . how about this one ? _eos
_go this will be fine , thanks . _eos
_go ( handing her a menu ) your waiter will be here in a minute to take your order . _eos
_go thank you . _eos
_go what is your problem ? _eos
_go my children can never be obedient even if i criticized them severely . _eos
_go you need not always do that . why do n't you pat them on the back occasionally ? _eos
_go sorry , sir . that table has been booked . _eos
_go well , in that case , this table is the only choice . _eos
_go actually you can have a window seat if you do n't mind a ten - minute wait . _eos
_go there is no need . thanks . _eos
_go so am i . _eos

_go yes , please . i ca n't stand watching the channel any more . _eos
_go i think they have pretty good programmes . but i 'll change it if you really want . _eos
_go put it on channel 5 , ok ? _eos

_go you should look at your claim form and see if it has been more than fourteen days since it was due . if it has n't been , we will still accept it . _eos
_go can i mail it in early next time so it is n't late ? _eos
_go actually , you can not mail it in early , as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date . _eos

_go well , what about $ 70 with a scarf ? _eos
_go it 's my rock bottom price . take it or leave it . _eos
_go i am afraid not . are there any vacant tables ? _eos
_go i do n't think so . you have to wait for about 10 minutes . _eos
_go that 's all right . _eos
_go yes , what do you want to know ? _eos
_go the information is scanty for me . and can you describe the responsibilities of the position ? _eos
_go yes . copywriters are supposed to design and write articles for the advertising company . _eos
_go i 'd like to have it in big waves . _eos
_go shall i put some oil on ? b _eos
_go i 'm glad to see you ! _eos

_go ok . _eos
_go i 'll get the flour out . _eos
_go let me help you . _eos
_go thank you for allowing us 3 % reduction , but still we find your price is on the high side . _eos
_go this is our rock - bottom price , and we ca n't make any further reduction . _eos
_go if so , we find it difficult for us to go on with our talks . _eos
_go then what 's your counter - offer ? _eos
_go this is our counter - offer . _eos
_go we are sincere to make business with you , but the difference between your counter - offer and our price is too great . _eos
_go so are we . our counter - offer is in line with the world market . _eos
_go how about meeting each other half - way in order to conclude the business ? _eos
_go agreed . _eos
_go i usually have cereal for breakfast . _eos
_go but is n't it served with cold milk ? _eos
_go yeah . cold milk wakes me up . _eos
_go chinese people do n't like to eat cold food . _eos
_go is that right ? _eos
_go but i 'm open to new things . i 'll have a bowl of cereal , too . _eos
_go with cold milk ? _eos
_go with cold milk ! _eos
_go that is very encouraging news . i heard that the marketing department has done a three months research , they sent the feedback information to the research and development center by the end of every month . that is to say , the r & d center redesigned the product twice before it was launched into the market . _eos
_go it is not an easy job . how do you like the advertisement for the new product ? _eos
_go that is the best one i have seen . i am sure our target customers , young people will love it . _eos
_go certainly . _eos
_go our computer lab on the first floor has a copy machine , sir . _eos
_go great ! how much per copy ? _eos
_go sir , one copy is ten cents . _eos
_go okay , i 'll be down there shortly . _eos
_go you probably wo n't have to wait for anyone , sir . _eos
_go thanks , jim . i did n't think guys paid attention to stuff like that . _eos
_go no , we just do n't usually admit it ! _eos
_go well , thanks for the compliment anyway ! _eos
_go yes . now we are in the olympic stadium , the center of this park . _eos
_go splendid ! when is it gon na be finished ? _eos
_go the whole stadium is to be finished this june . _eos
_go how many seats are there in the stand ? _eos
_go oh , there are 5000 seats in total . _eos
_go i did n't know it would be so big ! _eos
_go it is ! look there , those are the tracks . and the jumping pit is over there . _eos
_go ah ... i see . hey , look the sign here , no climbing . _eos
_go we put many signs with english translations for foreign visitors . _eos
_go ok . well the problem is that the apartments in the heart of the city are usually more expensive . _eos
_go i know , that 's my problem . what do you think i should do ? _eos
_go well , maybe you could get a two - bedroom apartment downtown and share the rent with a roommate . _eos
_go oh , great idea ! _eos
_go well , i love it . the room is spacious and clean with big windows and a lot of sunshine . there are plants along the corridor . especially , i got my own desk with computer and telephone . such a great place ! _eos
_go that 's very good . i once turn down a job offer just because the office is awful . _eos
_go what was so bad about it ? _eos
_go small rooms , small window , a small desk shared by three people . i would have been interrupted all the time and for sure not be able to deliver good work . _eos
_go sounds bad ! lucky you ! you did n't take that job . i think a good office environment is also important to work efficiently . _eos
_go totally agree . by the way , the number of the telephone on your desk is extension 506 . you can pick up your office supplies from the supply room at the end of the corridor . _eos
_go yes , that 's right . after graduating from high school in new york i attended york university in the uk . my major was english , and my minor was business studies . i completed my ba in 2004 . _eos
_go yes , i 'm pleased to see that you also got a distinction . _eos
_go yes that 's right . i 've always enjoyed studying . my friends say i 'm a bit of a bookworm , but my father always pushed us to succeed academically . _eos
_go well , it looks like his encouragement paid off rebecca . so how about extracurricular activities at university ? _eos
_go well i 've always been keen on writing , so i became the editor for the university student magazine , which i really loved . also i volunteered for a group called shelter , to help the homeless in york . _eos
_go what did that involve ? _eos
_go providing warm meals and shelter , especially in the winter months . i found it really fulfilling to be part of that group . _eos
_go i 'm sure . okay , now let 's move on to your work experience , shall we ? _eos
_go yes , okay . _eos
_go what would you like ? _eos
_go twenties and some smaller bills , please . _eos
_go anything else ? _eos
_go yes . could you tell many balance ? here 's account number . _eos
_go it 's nothing serious . but i always have a headache , and i have n't slept properly for several weeks . i 've also lost appetite and my eyes are burning . _eos
_go mm , you do look rather pale . let me take your temperature . would you put the thermometer under your arm , please ? now , let me listen to your pulse . mm , do you feel weak ? _eos
_go yes , i never seem to have any energy . _eos
_go i 'll give you a blood test . would you roll up your sleeve ? just as i thought . you 're anemic . you 'd better pay more attention to your diet . eat plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables and food high in protein . and do n't stay up late working . try to get more rest . _eos
_go thank you . _eos
_go do you have a map of the campus ? _eos
_go yes , i have , but it does n't help me very much . i 'm not very good at reading maps . _eos
_go do you know where your classes are ? _eos
_go more or less . i go to three different buildings , and always get there late . i feel so hopeless . i do n't know why i am late all the time . no one else seems to be . _eos
_go that 's because you do n't know the short cuts . you 'll learn them after a while . i can show you the ropes . _eos
_go which train do you like ? _eos
_go t112 to washington please . _eos
_go may i have your name ? _eos
_go that 's lincoln . _eos
_go i ca n't wait to vote . _eos
_go who are you voting for ? _eos
_go the person i 'm voting for is the best . _eos
_go what do you like about him ? _eos
_go he is very intelligent . _eos
_go you think so ? _eos
_go that 's right . plus , i agree with his policies . _eos
_go i 'm glad to hear that you are so excited . _eos
_go i 'm voting for the next president . _eos
_go i 'm sure he will be . _eos
_go i 'm going to make sure and vote . _eos
_go yes , i 'd like to check out now . my name 's adams , room 312 . here 's the key . _eos
_go one moment , please , sir . ... here 's your bill . would you like to check and see if the amount is correct ? _eos
_go what 's the 14 pounds for ? _eos
_go that 's for the phone calls you made from your room . _eos
_go can i pay with traveller 's cheques ? _eos
_go certainly . may i have your passport , please ? _eos
_go here you are . _eos
_go could you sign each cheque here for me ? _eos
_go sure . _eos
_go here are your receipt and your change , sir . thank you . _eos
_go thank you . goodbye . _eos
_go i tend to work well with people who are confident and straightforward . it 's more difficult for me to be around timid people , because i move quickly and i am decisive . _eos
_go what things impress you in your colleagues ? _eos
_go i admire and work best with people who are of good character and integrity . i also think confidence and enthusiasm is positive in any business environment . _eos
_go what are some of the things your supervisor did that you disliked ? _eos
_go the only thing i really do n't like is to get feedback in front of others . i want to hear good and bad feedback in private , so that i have time to think and react to the issue without other distractions . i believe that 's the fair way to improve learning or to change future behavior . _eos
_go how do you organize and plan for major projects ? _eos
_go i love to brainstorm a best , worst , and most likely scenario . then , i set a timetable that 's realistic . what i usually find is that some combination of my schedule easily as these things unfold because i 've already visualized what could happen and how i 'd react . _eos
_go describe an experience when you had to work under great pressure . _eos
_go i had to complete an end of quarter report once while i was on the road for two consecutive weeks . the amount of telephoning back and forth was incredible , because i could't bring my office files with me . luckily i had a great secretary and a logical filling system , so we located everything we needed . _eos
_go how do you manage your time in a typical day ? _eos
_go i 've always given priority to work with established clients , because they offer a better risk / return value . the last thing i do is general correspondence , especially internal correspondence , which i take care of at the end of the day or week . _eos
_go describe a time when you acted on someone 's suggestion . _eos
_go i changed my open office hours because several of my employees found it difficult to visit me except in the early mornings . _eos
_go yeah , i deleted all that superstitious crap . what a waste of bandwidth ! _eos
_go i figured i might as well send one or two of them out . maybe my luck will get better . _eos
_go do you really think the dalai lama sent that ? i 'm tired of all these forwards . _eos
_go it 's worth a shot . maybe we 'll get some luck in thinking up something for this case . _eos
_go you are not late , mr . thomas . there 're still 15 minutes to go . mr . white has just called you . _eos
_go what did he say ? _eos
_go he said there was a traffic jam , but he is coming . _eos
_go he should n't drive his car . he should come here by bus . _eos
_go some what ? _eos
_go some chinese food . i 'm hungry , and there 's a take - out restaurant near here . we can have them deliver and then watch the news on tv while we eat . _eos
_go no , i 'd rather go out . the chinese food here is rather different from what i had at home . maybe we can try some other food today ... what about that all - you - can - eat place we passed the other day , the one over in the shopping center ? _eos
_go okay . i could go for that . it 's called al 's steakhouse . they also have great fried fish , and i love their salad bar . you can go back to refill your plate as often as you like . _eos
_go is that the place that serves such large portions of meat ? _eos
_go yes , their steaks are enormous . sometimes i ca n't finish what i 've ordered . _eos
_go what if that happens to me ? i hate to let food go to waste . _eos
_go do n't worry . we 'll just get a doggie bag . _eos
_go i know something about it . our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills . _eos
_go it takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures , so i can not bear it anymore . it is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills . _eos
_go is that true ? _eos
_go definitely ! _eos
_go if that information is exact , i guess our company is willing to promote someone . _eos
_go i would like to buy some flowers , please . something really nice . _eos
_go i see , may i ask what the occasion is ? _eos
_go it 's not really an occasion , it 's more like i 'm sorry . _eos
_go very well . this arrangement here is very popular among regretful husbands and boyfriends . it has a dozen long stem red roses with a couple of sunflowers and a single orchid that stands out . it includes a small teddy bear to achieve the effect of immediate forgiveness . _eos
_go i think i 'm gon na need more than just a dozen red roses and a bear . what else do you recommend ? _eos
_go mmm , well this is our i 'm sorry i cheated on you package . two dozen red roses lined with tulips , carnations and lilies . the fragrance and beauty of this flower arrangement is sure to make her forgive you . _eos
_go i do n't think that 's gon na cut it . i need something bigger and better ! _eos
_go i 'm sorry sir but , what exactly did you do ? _eos
_go well , i may have accidentally insinuated that she is getting chubbier . _eos
_go get out of my store , you jerk ! _eos
_go i 'm very sorry , sir . i could put you on a waiting list , but you would be wise to check out other means of travel . _eos
_go you mean like a bus ? have you ever traveled for ten hours on a bus before ? _eos
_go i have not sir . but i do have a number for a very comfortable bus that goes to chicago every hour from here . _eos
_go alright , give me the number . but put me on that waiting list as well . _eos
_go here is the number , and your name is on the waiting list . _eos
_go how many people are on the waiting list right now ? _eos
_go right now i show that there are 176 people on the list . and you are number 176 . _eos
_go i do n't think that there is any easy way . the united nations could send peacekeepers into the country . at least then the warring parties could be forced to negotiate . _eos
_go so , if the cause is poverty , there should be a program to make the country richer . if the problem is resources , share them . _eos
_go it sounds easy when you say it like that . in reality , it 's harder to make peace between countries . _eos
_go yes , it is . one way to stop countries fighting is to cut off their financial support . wars are very expensive . _eos
_go i 'm sorry , mr . myers . i 've just been so busy today . _eos
_go i really do n't want to hear your excuses , janet . we 're running a busy office here . you 're going to have to keep up . _eos
_go you 're right , sir . i apologize . i 'll get those files for you now . _eos
_go i prefer a sedentary job and i used to work as an operator . _eos
_go we need an operator now . _eos
_go it 's just the job i 've been searching for . _eos
_go i know . it really makes a mess of the whole election process . _eos
_go and it takes up all the news . _eos
_go the problem is that there always a large number of people who eat that kind of stuff up . _eos
_go it 's so small . the fact that there is public interest , does n't say much for us as the public . _eos
_go have you ever listened to am radio ? it 's quite a different experience than the traditional news stations on tv and fm radio . _eos
_go i do n't remember the last time i listened to am radio . _eos
_go another place you can get real insight is european papers . you can get them on - line . _eos
_go i can check that for you right now . would you mind holding ? _eos
_go sure . no problem . _eos
_go mr . robson , i 'm sorry . our computer system is down . could i call you back later ? _eos
_go sure . do you have my number ? _eos
_go yes , i have it right here . i 'm so sorry about this . _eos
_go no problem . i 'll wait for your call . _eos
_go i 'm working on my resume . _eos
_go really ? did you find any information about a new job ? _eos
_go yeah , i just got some good information off the internet . _eos
_go great ! do you think you have a chance at getting the job ? _eos
_go i did n't just find out about one job . there were several ones that looked good . _eos
_go maybe i should try looking on the web for work . _eos
_go sure you have to be patient . but i think it 's much less trouble to sit in front of a computer than to go door to door or to make a lot of phone calls . _eos
_go but there must be so many people who also see the advertisement for that job on the net . you might have no chance . _eos
_go how do you know if you do n't have a try ? _eos
_go is this the one you want ? _eos
_go no , the one next to it . _eos
_go here you are . _eos
_go thanks . what kind of stone is this ? _eos
_go it 's a ruby . it is from south africa . would you like to try it on ? _eos
_go yes , please . how much is it ? _eos
_go it costs $ 200 . _eos
_go it looks good . ok . i 'll take it . _eos
_go thank you , lisa . _eos
_go here is a present for you . i hope you like it . _eos
_go oh , great ! i love it ! you know i 've been expecting this for a long time . _eos
_go i 'm very glad to hear that . _eos
_go come here , let me introduce some friends to you . _eos
_go i 'm not sure , i feel hot and cold . _eos
_go when did the trouble start ? _eos
_go i was sick most of the night . _eos
_go it sounds like you are coming down with the flu . let me take your temperature . _eos
_go have i got a high fever ? _eos
_go yes , thirty - eight point seven . do you have a headache , chest or throat pain ? _eos
_go yes , i have . _eos
_go now , let me have a look at you . i 'd like to listen to your chest . now breathe in , a deep breath , that 's it cough , now again . i want to examine your throat , too . open wide , say'ah - - ' _eos
_go aaaaahh , aaaaahh . _eos
_go yes , it does look a bit sore . let 's take an x - ray of your chest and give you a few tests . _eos
_go all right , thanks . _eos
_go the tests showed nothing wrong . a slight viral infection . _eos
_go what shall i do today ? _eos
_go i 'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins . take an aspirin when you 've got a fever , and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours , and go home and rest in bed for two days . drink plenty of water , then you 'll feel better . here 's the prescription . _eos
_go you can be sure of that , sir . _eos
_go thank you . _eos
_go what did they say ? _eos
_go they said i need a new hard drive . _eos
_go that 's too bad . how much is a new one ? _eos
_go it 's not too much , only about $ 85 . _eos
_go plus installation ? _eos
_go no , my hard drive is easy to remove and replace . _eos
_go really ? _eos
_go yes , it 's just a couple of screws . _eos
_go that 's nice . _eos
_go it 's a lot better than paying someone $ 60 . _eos
_go if my hard drive crashes , i 'll just call you . _eos
_go do n't get up so late next time . you should have gone to bed earlier last night . _eos
_go yes , mum . _eos
_go i 'm worried about my daughter . she ca n't decide about college . _eos
_go do n't worry . that 's just a part of being a teenager . _eos
_go i do n't mind that . but she disagrees with me about everything . _eos
_go you should encourage her to make up her mind by herself . you should n't affect her decision . _eos
_go but i just want to give her some tips . _eos
_go oh , she can make her own decisions . _eos
_go i guess you are right . _eos
_go believe me . everything will be ok . _eos
_go i hope so . _eos
_go yes . i feel refreshed . _eos
_go how long will we dock ? _eos
_go in half an hour . the surface of the lake is calm . _eos
_go yes . we come at the right time . _eos
_go it sure was . i could n't eat another bite . _eos
_go well , it is getting pretty late . i think we should go home . _eos
_go you 're right . i have to get up early to go to work tomorrow . _eos
_go let 's see how much the bill is . _eos
_go do n't worry about it . tonight is my treat . _eos
_go what are you talking about ? we 'll split the bill . _eos
_go no , i insist . i kept telling you that i would treat you to dinner but i still have n't . _eos
_go no way , gordon . i know that you are a little short on cash at the moment . there 's no need for you to pay for the whole bill . _eos
_go alright , if that 's the way you are going to be , we 'll split the bill . _eos
_go that 's better . this way we will both have money to take a cab home , otherwise , you would probably have to walk . _eos
_go just promise you will let me treat you to dinner next week , ok ? _eos
_go you 've got a deal . _eos
_go great . bye . _eos
_go bye . _eos
_go yes . i 'm going to the untied states for travel . what places do you recommend ? _eos
_go in my opinion , there are several places you must n't miss , like washington d . c , las vegas , new york and los angeles . _eos
_go someone suggests that i should go to seattle and hawaii . _eos
_go yes , you may consider those two places also . seattle , for example , is worth visiting and there 's a very famous museum called museum of flight . _eos
_go and seattle is the home of microsoft and boeing . that must be a great place . i ca n't miss it . _eos
_go you know , i fell in love with this house the first moment i laid eyes on it . _eos
_go the style of the exterior is just what i 've been looking for ! _eos
_go the exterior is only half of the story . the interior is incredible . _eos
_go this home is gorgeous on the inside ! _eos
_go everything that you see on the walls , floors , and windows is brand new . _eos
_go the wall colors totally suit the style of this house . _eos
_go straight ahead is the gourmet kitchen . _eos
_go i love the bamboo flooring and granite countertops . _eos
_go the master suite is the best . let 's go look at that next . _eos
_go there is plenty of room for our king - sized bed , and i love the light in this room . _eos
_go i know that you like this house , but let 's take a look at the others before you make up your mind . _eos
_go l am afraid there is n't any fancy soap in my room . _eos
_go sorry sir , we will bring you one . anything else ? _eos
_go yes . bring me a bath towel as well . _eos
_go can i make a reservation for flight fw58 to san marino ? _eos
_go sure . when do you want to take the plane ? _eos
_go next monday . _eos
_go will that be first class or economy seat ? _eos
_go what 's the fare for a first class seat ? _eos
_go $ 200 . _eos
_go oh . i am not a wall streeter . give me an economy one please . _eos
_go yes , hello again . i would like to know the exact difference between dividend deposit and dividend participated deposit . _eos
_go that 's pretty easy to explain . with the deposit , the interest is fixed , but the dividend of each policy will be transferred automatically into your bank account by the end of each year . the longer the term , the higher the dividend you earn . this is because it is calculated at the compound interest rate . _eos
_go and i can purchase that here ? _eos
_go yes . and if you already have a current account with us , the insurance premium can be paid through it , which saves all of us a lot of hassle . _eos
_go yes , what kind of room do you want ? _eos
_go i prefer one facing the sea . besides , it should have a shower . _eos
_go sorry , right now we can only have you a room without shower . _eos
_go well , that 's fine . _eos
_go that 's easy . it was your office ergonomics that decided me . _eos
_go you 're kidding ! something as simple as that ? _eos
_go yes . it is very important to me . my mother worked in offices for twenty years , and she finally had carpal tunnel syndrome . i have been reading about repetitive stress injuries , and i know that t _eos
_go yes , there has been a lot of research into rsi 's . something so simple as proper chair height can prevent injuries . tell me , did anything else influence your decision ? _eos
_go yes , i noticed that you have professional training and team - building days . i like the idea of working for a company that invests in its staff . _eos
_go well , welcome to the team . _eos
_go oh , thank you . _eos
_go is there anything i can do for you now ? _eos
_go yes . i 'm rather tired and want to go to bed early . please make the bed . _eos
_go certainly , sir . _eos
_go marry lin please . _eos
_go sure , just a moment . ... i 'm sorry no one answer the phone . _eos
_go all right , could i leave a message ? _eos
_go certainly ! _eos
_go please ask her to call john . _eos
_go well , that 's what i 'm looking for myself . _eos
_go it 's very confusing in here , is n't it ? _eos
_go absolutely . oh , do you see a sign there ? _eos
_go it should be the way out . _eos
_go ok . let 's go and see . _eos
_go well , sir , i think i have made a mistake . i will take it back to the kitchen right now . _eos
_go i think you should be more careful next time . _eos
_go yes , sir . i 'm really so sorry about that . _eos
_go look , sally . i 've put just as much work into this as anybody else . _eos
_go no , i 'm sorry . i disagree . i do n't think you 've been working at full speed at all . _eos
_go well . i 'm sorry you feel that way . _eos
_go things are going good today . how have you been doing , mary ? _eos
_go things are going well for me , joe . _eos
_go want to go see a movie tonight ? _eos
_go my parents are taking me to dinner tonight . _eos
_go could you go with me to the movies on friday night , instead ? _eos
_go what movie did you want to see ? _eos
_go there is a new horror flick about a rapist serial killer . _eos
_go i was thinking that i would like to see " the secret life of bees . " _eos
_go oh great ! sounds like something i need to bring kleenex to ! _eos
_go tired and stressed . this wedding is giving me a headache . _eos
_go just relax . with me as your maid of honor , everything will be fine ! _eos
_go i 'm worried that everything will be chaotic ! _eos
_go hey ! i 'm the tour guide . i 'll take care of the taiwanese guests . _eos
_go you 're going to have to tell them what to do in church , what everything means ... _eos
_go i will . do n't worry ! _eos
_go nothing , mummy . i was hungry so i came here for some milk . _eos
_go milk ? i thought you did n't like milk . _eos
_go i do n't , but i could n't find anything to eat in the refrigerator . _eos
_go nonsense . there 's lots of food in the refrigerator ... what 's behind your back ? _eos
_go nothing . _eos
_go what are you hiding behind your back ? let me see . _eos
_go promise that you wo n't get angry . _eos
_go ok , i promise . what is it ? _eos
_go it 's a kitty . _eos
_go oh , jim . i told you . no pets . it 'll make a mess of this house . _eos
_go please , mummy . everybody else in my class keeps a pet . please , i 'll take care of it . it 's a good kitty . it 'll not bring you any trouble . _eos
_go no way . it might belong to somebody else . you ca n't keep it here . _eos
_go please , mummy . i found it this afternoon by the garbage bin . it was starving and looking for something to eat . please ! you see , it 's so cute and tame . _eos
_go all right . but you have to clean up everything it messes up . _eos
_go i will . thank you , mummy . _eos
_go sure , anything you say . _eos
_go actually , it 's a little bit silly . _eos
_go do n't worry about it , just ask . _eos
_go what words do i need to know to buy a pair of shoes ? _eos
_go you need to know the type of shoes you want . _eos
_go do n't worry about that . i can point it out in the store . _eos
_go the shoes can be comfortable or not comfortable , too wide , too narrow , or just right ; and long or short . in girls shoes , the heel can be high or low . _eos
_go let me write all that down . i 'm going shopping this afternoon . _eos
_go it has been 12 years since it was founded in 1998 . _eos
_go so , it has a history for more than a decade ? _eos
_go yes . and it was incorporated with other businesses in 2008 due to the global financial crisis . _eos
_go can you help me with comprehensive credit granting ? _eos
_go certainly , madam . what would you like to know ? _eos
_go well , everything really . _eos
_go all right . we can grant a financing promise quota , if you qualify . this means that we can deal with all of your needs in a speedy and efficient way . firstly , your credit rating must be class a , and your debt to asset ratio must be top notch , for the industry you are involved in . _eos
_go all right . but i do n't want to play tennis . we played tennis last weekend . _eos
_go okay . what do you want to do ? _eos
_go i want to go jogging . _eos
_go all right . that sounds like fun . _eos
_go i am terribly sorry . you did n't come to reconfirm recently . you should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it 's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled . _eos
_go but i have been so busy all these days . well , is there any other ticket available ? i want the next one . _eos
_go does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? the same is true in the west . _eos
_go no , absolutely not ! on the contrary , you 'll be considered a well - connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . but always pay attention to what you say . if the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested . _eos
_go you mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? that goes in like with confucius'preachings , right ? _eos
_go correct . show respect for the older people . conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other . _eos
_go any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ? _eos
_go yes , plenty of them . do n't eat fast ! people usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . and all the dishes should not be eaten up completely . _eos
_go is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ? _eos
_go haha , i 'm afraid it 's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate . _eos
_go we will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? that will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . the office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock . _eos
_go you can double check with the housekeeping department , but i am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . they are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . as long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order . _eos
_go ok , i will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . is there anything else we need to order while i am at it ? _eos
_go i think the only thing is toner . try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . we should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time . _eos
_go ok , will do . _eos
_go what size do you want ? _eos
_go i wear size 40 . _eos
_go how about this one ? it 's the latest design . _eos
_go oh , i like the color . _eos
_go i 'm looking for a pair of shoes . _eos
_go what size do you wear ? these shoes are on sale . _eos
_go i wear size 36 . this pair looks nice . can i try them on ? _eos
_go of course , yes . they look nice . and they 're not expensive . _eos
_go how much are they ? _eos
_go they are $ 168 . _eos
_go i 'll take them . _eos
_go i think it is good if we know enough about career planning . we will make wiser choices . what else did he tell you about it ? _eos
_go well , just something in general , like several key steps in planning career and how to set specific and tenable goals . _eos
_go sounds practical ! to be honest , sometimes i feel puzzled about my future career . i am not sure if this job suits me the best though i work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . i have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills . _eos
_go making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . it seems that you need this course more than i do . i love my current job . if i take this course , i hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . if they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . i need these to improve my current work performance . _eos
_go ok , then we can sign up for it together . _eos
_go i think it 's the postman . will you go and open the door ? _eos
_go all right . i 'll get it . _eos
_go no , we do n't . _eos
_go how many of you , please ? _eos
_go six , including two kids . _eos
_go i 'm afraid all the big tables are taken . _eos
_go if you go onto our website and put in your password , you can access your test results . _eos
_go are you saying that there were n't any problems ? _eos
_go i will always have you come in for a discussion if there is a major problem . _eos
_go will i be able to read the results on the website and understand them ? _eos
_go yes , if you go there , you can see what each test is about . _eos
_go how will i know what the numbers mean ? _eos
_go you can see your results and how they compare to the normal range . _eos
_go how can i see test results from tests i have taken before ? _eos
_go we put all of your test results up in the same place . just check the dates for what you need . _eos
_go if that 's the case . there 's not much point in further discussion . we might as well call the whole deal off . _eos
_go what i mean is that we 'll never be able to come down to your price . the gap is too great . _eos
_go i think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . how about meeting each other halfway ? _eos
_go what 's your proposal ? _eos
_go your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . well , i suggest we meet each other halfway . _eos
_go do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? that 's impossible ! _eos
_go what would you suggest ? _eos
_go the best we can do is another 30 dollars off . that 's definitely the lowest we can go . _eos
_go that still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . let 's meet each other half - away again and split the difference ; i think this is a price we can both be satisfied with . _eos
_go ok . we can meet halfway again . _eos
_go good morning , ruth . did i wake you up ? _eos
_go no , i was just about to get up . what 's up , carl ? _eos
_go listen , i am calling to confirm what you said yesterday . are we supposed to meet at the chinatown terminal of the avenue b bus or d bus ? _eos
_go b as in boy . you should get off at the last stop in chinatown . _eos
_go oh , you mean canal street ? _eos
_go that 's the wrong direction . canal street is on the other side of chinatown . _eos
_go oh , i get it . when did we decide to meet ? _eos
_go at 10,45 . is ann coming along ? _eos
_go i can not get hold of her yet . _eos
_go see you around , carl . _eos
_go see you later . _eos
_go yes , we have . we 've had to clean up our production process a lot to meet tough government standards . _eos
_go what about your use of raw materials ? _eos
_go well , we 've had to cut down the amount of solvents we use and we 're not allowed to use lead in our products any more . _eos
_go what happens if you exceed the limits ? _eos
_go we try not to because you might have to pay quite a heavy fine . _eos
_go that 's the best there is . _eos
_go okay , i 'll take one . _eos
_go that 'll be $ 200 , sir . _eos
_go yes , please . we 're on our way out , so we put the'make up'sign on . could you bring us some towels and hangers ? _eos
_go no problem , sir . everything will be ready when you come back . _eos
_go external factors . i think the main external factors are political , economic , social and technological factors . _eos
_go what are the internal factors that influence the company ? _eos
_go the internal factors are composed of human resources , team spirit , innovation spirit and coordination between different departments , etc . _eos
_go what words ? can you tell me ? _eos
_go he says kick mommy , beat mommy , do n't want mommy , very quickly if i do something that he does n't like . you know , if i wash his face or change his clothes , things like that . _eos
_go honey , i do n't know what to tell you . of course tony is a young child . but do not underestimate his ability to learn and reason . _eos
_go yes , but sometimes he is just not reasonable . _eos
_go i suggest you treat him with patience , affection , and respect . if he needs to do something , like go to bed , or be washed , etc . , please guide or help him to get it done , but lead him with gentleness . _eos
_go it 's easy to say , but i will try . _eos
_go motivate tony to cooperate by rewarding his good behavior . do not emphasize punishment for bad moods , etc . do not threaten him with punishment if he resists the actions you desire . _eos
_go i know my parents sometimes threaten to punish him . but this does n't work , instead he picks up another bad habit . _eos
_go yes , i am james mason from anderson and associates . i would like to see mr . smith . _eos
_go do you have an appointment ? _eos
_go yes , he knows i 'm coming . our meeting is set for 2 o'clock . _eos
_go i wonder if mr . smith forgot your meeting . i am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until after 4 pm . let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place . will you please have a seat ? _eos
_go sure . _eos
_go yes , mr . mason , i just checked with our office manager , ms . terry , she said mr . smith briefed her on your project . she is just finishing up a meeting now . she could be with your shortly . would you like me to show you around while you are waiting ? _eos
_go that would be very nice . thank you . _eos
_go right this way , mr . mason . we can start with our front office . when ms . terry is ready , you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor . there is a conference room already prepared _eos
_go no , but i heard about that angelina jolie and brad pitt did n't attend . _eos
_go yes , that was surprising . i heard that they got into a fight and then decided not to go . _eos
_go they must be the most famous celebrity couple in hollywood . _eos
_go they 're also one of the richest couples . they have so many money and they can buy almost anything they want . _eos
_go i also heard that tom cruise and katie holmes made an appearance at the oscars . _eos
_go did either one of them win an oscar this year ? _eos
_go i think tom might have been nominated for one of his films , but i do n't think he won anything . _eos
_go tom cruise may be handsome , but i think he 's a bit crazy , do n't you ? _eos
_go yes , his marriage to katie is actually quite scandalous . _eos
_go i still think that they only got married to get more publicity for their movies and themselves . _eos
_go people in show biz can have such an easy life ; i do n't know why they have to make it so complicated . _eos
_go i would never want to be a celebrity because the paparazzi would also be after you . _eos
_go that 's true . i guess it would be difficult to have people taking pictures of you everywhere you go . _eos
_go thank goodness we 're not rich and famous ! _eos
_go being famous , i can do without , but i would n't mind being rich . _eos
_go could i purchase euro with rib here ? i have to stay here for months . _eos
_go yes , the rate for cash purchases is listed on the electronica screen , so you have seen the rate of exchange . _eos
_go yes , i have known of it . _eos
_go how much do you like to exchange ? _eos
_go 20,000 rib . _eos
_go in what denominations ? _eos
_go it does n't matter , but leave me some small changes , that will be convenient in daily life . _eos
_go right , i will exchange for you now . please sign the exchange form giving the name and telephone . _eos
_go well , could you change them too ? the dollars , i want to change them into swiss francs . _eos
_go ok , wait for a moment . well , i am sorry , but we are not authorized to exchange coins because it is low and we do not have enough foreign coins . in this case , you 'd better change 2,000 $ to swiss francs . _eos
_go it does n't matter . _eos
_go please sign the memo on the bottom and keep your money and memo . _eos
_go thanks a lot . good - bye . _eos
_go we 'd like to hear your account of the events of last night . _eos
_go that would be nice . how are you getting there ? _eos
_go well , i prefer to go on the train , but i suppose you want me to take the car . _eos
_go oh , i much prefer to go by car , then we do n't need to get to the station with our luggage and ... _eos
_go and i 've got to drive . you know i 'm not fond of that . i found it much more relaxing to sit in the train . _eos
_go which is more expensive ? _eos
_go but very much quicker . but i know we 'll never agree on this subject . you prefer the car . i prefer the train . _eos
_go now , have you ever thought of going by express bus ? _eos
_go what a wonderful neighborhood ! can you find that house on our open house list ? _eos
_go yes , that is one of the houses that we have on our list . _eos
_go they always make the front yards look so great for open houses . let 's see what the inside looks like . _eos
_go i am going to go sign my name in the registry to let the listing agent know that we were here . _eos
_go signing the registry is a good idea . i think i want to see the kitchen next . _eos
_go i really appreciate that the listing agent provided water on such a hot day . _eos
_go i need to pick up a flyer with the information about the house on it . _eos
_go is the current asking price listed on the flyer ? _eos
_go the asking price has recently gone down to two hundred and twenty - five thousand dollars . _eos
_go oh , madam , buy what ? _eos
_go a new car . and i 've got a small family , two children , and i have n't got a lot of money and ... _eos
_go oh , oh , madam , madam , i 'm afraid you have the wrong number . _eos
_go is n't this the car store ? _eos
_go no . it 's mike 's sporting goods . _eos
_go oh , sorry . do you know the number for a car store , then ? _eos
_go no . i do n't . i suggest you look in the phone book . _eos
_go i 'm sorry to have bothered you . _eos
_go no problem . _eos
_go that 's great . what 's on tonight ? _eos
_go i am not sure about the name of the film , but i know it 's a romantic one . _eos
_go romantic ? i am afraid i like thrillers better . _eos
_go do n't you think it 's too bloody ? _eos
_go on the contrary , very exciting . _eos
_go what day was your appointment on ? _eos
_go my appointment was on monday . _eos
_go what time had you chosen ? _eos
_go it was for 10 _eos
_go i am looking at your appointment right now . what day would you prefer ? _eos
_go i would prefer next thursday . _eos
_go what time would be best for you ? _eos
_go i want to come in at 2 _eos
_go i am writing you down for that time . we look forward to seeing you . _eos
_go hi , robert . this is janet reese calling from american advertising . we placed an order with you about a week ago . _eos
_go yes , ms . reese . i remember , you spoke with me . is there a problem ? _eos
_go well , it still has n't gotten here , and my boss is pretty angry about it . _eos
_go thank you . it 's a pleasure to meet you . _eos
_go a pleasure meeting you as well , the flowers are for you . _eos
_go thank you , they are beautiful . _eos
_go that 's so great ! _eos
_go how much are you selling it for ? _eos
_go this t . v is only $ 2500 . _eos
_go you ca n't be serious . _eos
_go that 's how much this t . v costs . _eos
_go that 's too expensive for me . _eos
_go this television is of very high quality . _eos
_go you ca n't go down on the price . _eos
_go by how much ? _eos
_go i 'll buy it for $ 2000 . _eos
_go i 'm sorry , but the price is final . _eos
_go yes , i packed it myself , and it has n't been out of my possession . _eos
_go are you bringing in any plants or animal products ? _eos
_go no . _eos
_go our sniffer dog seems to disagree . do you mind if we look in your suitcase ? _eos
_go not at all . go right ahead . _eos
_go what 's this sir ? _eos
_go it 's traditional chinese medicine . i mix it with hot water like tea . sorry . i forgot about it . _eos
_go what are these red things sir ? _eos
_go oh no ! i forgot about those too ! those are chinese sausages for my aunt lily . _eos
_go i 'm sorry sir , but you ca n't take any of this into the country . we will also have to check your carry - on . please step this way . don't'be nervous ; we 'll just look through it briefly and then _eos
_go hold on a second please . i 'm sorry . he has gone out . _eos
_go oh . this is paul . when will he be back ? _eos
_go he will be back at about seven o'clock . _eos
_go can i leave a message please ? _eos
_go yes , certainly . _eos
_go please tell him i 'll call him at the office tomorrow afternoon . _eos
_go all right . i 'll tell him when he comes back . _eos
_go thank you very much . _eos
_go not yet , but i 'm thinking of it . have you bought one , dad ? _eos
_go i took out a life insurance policy and made your mother the beneficiary . _eos
_go can you tell me why you want to buy it ? _eos
_go i am a fireman and it is a dangerous job . i have to consider your mother 's life . _eos
_go oh , i see . do you advise me to buy one ? _eos
_go you have children now . what if something , god forbid , happens to you ? _eos
_go that 's true . well , how much do you think i should get ? _eos
_go a $ 100 000 policy should n't be too expensive . here , call my agent . he 'll give you a good deal . _eos
_go yes , i do , susan . just a moment . here it is . _eos
_go thank you , sir . sorry to trouble you . _eos
_go not at all , susan . just tell him to leave it with my secretary when he 's finished with it _eos
_go i 'm going to the hospital to see susan . _eos
_go i saw her yesterday . she was a little better . _eos
_go must i catch a number 7 bus to get there ? _eos
_go no , you need n't . a number 13 bus will also take you to the hospital . _eos
_go number 13 buses run much more frequently , do n't they ? _eos
_go yes . i caught a number 7 bus yesterday , and they said i had taken a wrong bus . _eos
_go thank you , henry . i 'll get a number 13 . _eos
_go but number 13 buses leave from the center of town . you 'll have to walk two miles to catch one . _eos
_go here you are . _eos
_go ah , thank you . please bring your luggage here for inspection . _eos
_go ok . but is there anything wrong ? _eos
_go it 's just a regular inspection . do you have anything to declare ? _eos
_go i 've got 6 packets of cigarettes and 2 bottles of champagne . besides , i have two cameras , one is for my own use , and the other is a gift . _eos
_go well , the cigarettes and the champagne are not in excess of the duty - free allowance . but according to our law , each passenger is allowed only one camera duty - free . you 'll have to pay duty for the other one . _eos
_go ok . where shall i pay duty for it ? _eos
_go please wait a minute . i 'll make out the duty memo ... here you are . take this and pay to the woman over there . _eos
_go i 've paid for it . here 's the receipt . _eos
_go very well . i hope you 'll enjoy your stay in america . _eos
_go thank you . _eos
_go nice to see you , too . i heard you are a staff of nokia company . _eos
_go yes , i 'm satisfied with this job . _eos
_go congratulations . what did you do during the interview ? _eos
_go pay more attention to the external expressions , because they are important for the first impression . good manner and style of conversation can let other feel your good self - cultivation . good gestures and mien can let other feel very comfortable . _eos
_go how can i have the good external expressions ? _eos
_go do n't worry about that . you just pay more attention to the details of people 's action in life , and you will know how to transfer information by their body language . _eos
_go hello , welcome to universal bank . please insert your card into the slot . _eos
_go i know where to put my card ! stupid machine , talking to me like i 'm an idiot ... _eos
_go please input your 6 digit pin code followed by the pound key . thank you . please select an option . thank you . you have selected withdrawal . _eos
_go yeah , yeah , i know what i selected . just gimme my money ! _eos
_go please type the amount you would like to withdraw . thank you , you want to transfer 10000 usd to the world wildlife foundation . if this is correct please press 1 . _eos
_go no , no ! stupid machine , what are you doing ! no ! _eos
_go confirmed . thank you for using our bank ! please remove your card from the slot . goodbye ! _eos
_go no , no way ! what happened ? give me my money ! _eos
_go danger , danger ! the exits have been sealed and the doors will remain locked in until the local authorities arrive . thank you for using our bank . have a nice day . _eos
_go i am great ! how about you , mary ? how are you ? _eos
_go i am doing great ! thank you for asking , joe . _eos
_go i was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight ? _eos
_go i need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper . _eos
_go ok . what about going to the movies on friday night ? _eos
_go what were you planning on seeing ? _eos
_go i was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer . _eos
_go how about " the secret life of bees " ? _eos
_go that 's a chick flick ! _eos
_go first , i 'd make sure that we have a good , local , corporate lawyer . he or she will know all the local laws and regulations . _eos
_go that 's very important . a friend recommended a good law firm to me . we 'll need someone to hire staff . _eos
_go i think that we should send one of our hr people to do that . i do n't think we should use an agency , because they wo n't be familiar with the type of people we employ . have we decide on the location of _eos
_go yes . we have . we chose the location in the northeast of the city , not too far from the airport and on the edge of the cbd . _eos
_go why did n't we choose an office in the cbd ? _eos
_go the offices there were too expensive . have we negotiated any contracts yet ? _eos
_go yes . we 've signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries . we hope to sign another three this month . _eos
_go when will the branch office open ? _eos
_go hopefully next month . everything is a little rushed . we should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly . _eos
_go has and advertising campaign been prepared ? _eos
_go yes , it has . we 're going to target the business community through business magazines . _eos
_go i made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy . we should be able to get plenty of customers . _eos
_go i want to pick up my valuables . _eos
_go may i have your key please ? _eos
_go sure . here you are . _eos
_go here is your valuable . is that right ? _eos
_go yes , thank you . _eos
_go why ? i thought americans were supposed to be more open than that . _eos
_go well , for many religious people , they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers . _eos
_go do you think most people in america believe that abortion is wrong ? _eos
_go no , i think it 's mostly the older generation who are against abortions . _eos
_go it 's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in america . _eos
_go religious people blame it on pre - marital sex , not on abortion being illegal . _eos
_go what do you think about abortion ? _eos
_go i personally would never want to have one , but i think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman 's entire life , she should have the right to decide for herself . _eos
_go do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter ? _eos
_go i know this is going to sound sexist , but i do n't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children . _eos
_go why not ? it 's their children , too . _eos
_go that may be true , but when a woman gets pregnant , it changes her life completely . men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand . _eos
_go that might be true , but i think men should have some kind of say in the matter . _eos
_go but i do n't have any reading assignments . _eos
_go then review for your test . you 'll do even better . and maybe reading will help you get to sleep . _eos
_go aw , mom - you're such a drag . _eos
_go you say that now , lily , but you 'll thank me later . i 'm your mom , and mother knows best . _eos
_go sorry , we have n't made the decision at all . _eos
_go do you have any idea when you might arrive at a decision ? _eos
_go we will let you know probably next monday . i hope to give you a positive reply . _eos
_go i 'm willing to wait until you have come to a decision . _eos
_go you can check on the bulletin boards at school for local housing . _eos
_go what if i need a roommate ? _eos
_go there are websites that can hook you up with a roommate . _eos
_go how much do apartments cost around here ? _eos
_go it depends on what you want . do you want a one - or two - bedroom apartment ? _eos
_go i just need a one - bedroom apartment . _eos
_go that will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month . _eos
_go would you come with me to look at apartments ? _eos
_go i would be happy to look at apartments with you . _eos
_go heard what ? _eos
_go deborah already had her baby . _eos
_go i did n't know that . _eos
_go i thought you knew . _eos
_go i honestly did n't know . _eos
_go the baby was 8 pounds 6 ounces . _eos
_go that 's good to hear . _eos
_go will you go and visit them ? _eos
_go of course i will . _eos
_go i just wanted to give you the good news . _eos
_go thanks for letting me know . _eos
_go but that was the first thing that came into my mind when i heard the shout earthquake ! _eos
_go why not use staircases ? the terror was not so violent at that time . _eos
_go that would be too late . _eos
_go maybe the situation is too urgent . _eos
_go yes , i think i should have jumped in any case . _eos
_go i know what you mean . i 've started eating better myself . _eos
_go what foods do you eat now ? _eos
_go i tend to stick to fruits , vegetables , and chicken . _eos
_go those are the only things you eat ? _eos
_go that 's basically what i eat . _eos
_go why are n't you eating anything else ? _eos
_go well , fruits and vegetables are very healthy . _eos
_go and the chicken ? _eos
_go it 's really healthy to eat when you bake it . _eos
_go i guess that does sound a lot healthier . _eos
_go good morning ! welcome to our office ! _eos
_go nice to meet you ! my name is grace williams . _eos
_go nice to meet you too ! i am peter smith . _eos
_go today is my first day at work ! _eos
_go well , hope you will enjoy your first day ! just ask me if you need any help . _eos

_go what qualities do you think an advertising planner should have ? _eos
_go i think an advertising planner should have active thoughts , creative talent , and be sensitive to the changes in the market . _eos
_go what was the most important thing you have learned at work ? _eos
_go the most important thing i learned was that i must continuously improve my abilities . advertising is a constantly evolving trade and creativity is an important fact to success . if i want to make in marking in advertising industry , i ca n't stop studying and creating . _eos
_go dan is on top of that . i think they are also getting the handyman to fix the bathroom toilet that keeps clogging up . _eos
_go that would be convenient . they might as well ask him to fix the electrical wiring . the circuit breakers keep going out all the time . it 's really annoying ! _eos
_go yeah you are right . this office is falling apart ! frank told me the other day that the gutters outside were clogged and that 's why the parking lot was flooded . _eos
_go i know ! i was in ankle deep water trying to get to my car that day ! the handyman definitely has his work cut out for him . _eos

_go all right . ask me a question now . _eos
_go who invented the electric light bulb ? _eos
_go that 's easy . it was invented by edison . _eos

_go thank you . today i 'm writing a kind of poem called a chinese couplet . _eos

_go really ? then what do you do with it ? _eos
_go i give it away . here , this one is for you . _eos

_go very romantic ? _eos
_go yeah . he always tickled my finny bone with his college stories . _eos
_go you married him for that reason ? _eos
_go definitely not . the most important thing was we loved each other . _eos
_go yeah , some places are very short of water . _eos
_go because of pollution and other things , our environment has become worse and worse . _eos
_go you see , this time i traveled to the west . when i looked out of the windows of the rain , all the lands that i could see are as dry as a bone . _eos
_go it is serious . _eos
_go me too . _eos
_go she does have a heart of gold . _eos
_go you can say that again . _eos
_go you do n't really believe in all that hocus pocus mumbo jumbo , do you ? _eos
_go well , i have had many friends that went to a psychic and got their palms read and most of the things the psychic told her came true ! _eos
_go of course it does ! they tell you general and obvious things like that you will be successful or have a big house . i think most of the times they are just scam artists . _eos
_go well , historically it is a practice that many cultures share . reading the tarot cards , in the east they would even read tea leaves ! i even heard that there are people that make you smoke a cigar , and then read your ashes . _eos
_go all superstitious nonsense ! i would still like to go to one and see what he or she has to say , just for kicks . _eos
_go yes , i 'd like a book about law . _eos
_go would you tell me the name of the book and the author ? _eos

_go it is the most expensive . _eos

_go yes , i can give you regular unleaded . but you have to back up the car a little . _eos
_go give me regular unleaded then . i will back up . can you wash my windows for me ? _eos
_go i 'm sorry , sir . this is not a full service gas station . i will help you fill the gas , but we do n't wash windows here . _eos

_go josh and i were just on our way back home from the beach and thought we 'd drop by . _eos
_go i am so glad that you decided to stop by ! _eos
_go yes , it has been a long time since we have seen you . _eos
_go mary , can i get josh or you something to drink ? _eos
_go oh no , thank you . we are n't all that thirsty . _eos
_go how about a little snack then ? _eos

_go so find a guy to marry and you can get one ! _eos
_go i do n't need a guy to buy a wedding ring ! _eos
_go oh , i see . you 're going to wear one and pretend you 're married to try to attract guys . _eos
_go congratulation . what will you do ? _eos
_go they got me a part - time tutoring job , teaching an australian businessman chinese . _eos
_go that 's wonderful . i want to get a part - time job too . tell me what i should do . _eos
_go it 's very simple actually . you can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted . they will give you a call if any job comes up . _eos
_go good . i 'll do it . _eos
_go only once or twice at the most . _eos
_go do you know why ? _eos
_go i have no idea . _eos
_go you can have a bird view of guiling city from the top of the mountain . _eos
_go wonderful ! i 'll often come here for mountain climbing . _eos
_go you should . many guiliners , especially the old and the young , will climb mountains here in the morning . _eos
_go no wonder people say _eos
_go quick ! pass me your binoculars . look at that bird ... i 've never seen one of those before . it 's indigenous to guiling , and an endangered species too . this is lucky ! _eos
_go i did n't know you liked bird - watching . _eos
_go i do n't really . i just like wildlife , and you do n't get to see too much of it in the city . this place is full of it . _eos
_go aw , that 's sweet ! i knew your costume would be a success . _eos
_go it 's a success all right . the kids keep trying to catch me . _eos
_go yeah , i saw that . i thought you were playing a game with them . _eos
_go some game ! you try being tackled by ten kids at once ! _eos
_go um , holly ? look behind you . they 're coming this way . _eos
_go of course i 'd come . i could n't think of a better chance to see all my old friends . _eos
_go yeah . it 's hard to believe that it 's been ten years since graduation . it feels just yesterday we collected our diplomas . _eos
_go how time flies . but hey , how are things going with you ? _eos
_go oh , where to start ? there have been ups and downs . i 'm still trying to find my place in this world . it 's only recently that i 've been able to start settling down . how about you ? you still with jenn _eos
_go yeah , jenny and i got married right after graduation . it was tough the first years trying to make ends meet . i was supporting us both while she continued her studies . but now things are getting better _eos
_go oh , that sounds wonderful . i have always known you two would make it . i hope i can keep in better contact with you guys . i do n't want us to drift apart again . _eos
_go definitely ! actually , we just moved into a new place . there 's a house - warming party this saturday , if you are free ? i know jenny would love to see you again and it should be a good party . _eos
_go sounds great ! i 'll be there . _eos
_go and what if it does n't work out , right ? _eos
_go exactly . _eos
_go you need to quit thinking like a loser . invoking is going to kick butt . you know how i know ? _eos
_go how ? _eos
_go because i wo n't let it fail . _eos
_go but what about tomorrow ? what if stars . com decides to go with webtracker , and not us ? _eos
_go all set . i 've got my makeup , my cds , and my portable tv set ... _eos
_go hello ! we 're supposed to be getting back to nature . _eos
_go yeah , yeah . anyway ... i 'm packed . are you ? _eos
_go i 've been packed for a week . all my stuff is in this backpack . _eos
_go let me see ... two books ... birdseed ? _eos
_go that 's trail mix ! _eos
_go same difference . what 's this ? _eos
_go i hope we 'll get together again soon . _eos
_go i hope so . a good journey to you ! _eos
_go thank you . _eos
_go why do you say so ? everyone admires that you have a good wife . _eos
_go oh , no . when we were poor , we often tried our best to make ends meet . it was a hard time . _eos
_go but now you are rich . _eos
_go and we have some squabbles on some boring things . _eos
_go this is ordinary marriage life . _eos
_go do n't be kidding , ok ? _eos
_go what 's the matter ? so angry . i 'm just playing a joke with you . _eos
_go because i have given him up as a bad job . our relation has been over . _eos
_go yes , i think so , if you want to graduated this year , you 've got to take a science course . _eos
_go right , i figure since you are doing premedical , you know about the very courses . _eos
_go well , i have to take biology , chemistry , maps and physics . what you need is a good introductory course for non - science majors . _eos
_go yes , i really weak in maps , i did poorly in high school . _eos
_go that 's a problem . _eos
_go it 's beethoven . do you like it ? _eos
_go i think beethoven 's music is incredible . i 've heard that listening to it can make you more intelligent , too . do you believe that ? _eos
_go i do n't know about that , but i do think that it helps people relax . _eos
_go what other kind of music do you listen to ? _eos
_go actually , i mostly just listen classical music . what about you ? _eos
_go to be honest , i think classical music is too complicated for me . _eos
_go what kind of music do you prefer then ? _eos
_go i like pop music . do you ? _eos
_go not really . i do n't think pop music has much depth . _eos
_go i see what you mean . i think that 's way i like it so much . _eos
_go how long have you been in to pop music , then ? _eos
_go i 've always been into it . have you always liked classical music ? _eos
_go not really . when i was little , we did n't really listen to music at all . _eos
_go so , how did you become interested in it ? _eos
_go well , when i was about 10 years old , i started playing the piano . i think that 's how it all started . _eos
_go do you still play piano ? _eos
_go yes , it 's one of my hobbies . _eos
_go not good . my cousin is driving me up the wall . _eos
_go how so ? _eos
_go he stays up untill all hours of the night , and he never lifts a finger to help . _eos
_go have you talk to him about it ? _eos
_go not yet , but i have to soon . he 's eating me out of house and home . i caught him reading the fridge again last night _eos
_go ahahah , maybe that will help you lose weight . _eos
_go this is no laughing matter , nick . _eos
_go sorry paul . i could n't help it . so why does n't he give you a hand ? _eos
_go he watch the tob too much . now really i do n't know . but i ca n't handle this much longer . _eos
_go well , talk to him , and let me know what happens , ok ? _eos
_go yes , that 's right . _eos
_go what do you suggest i should see in new york ? _eos
_go well , how about the museum of modern art ? _eos
_go no , i do n't like museums . they 're boring . _eos
_go why do n't you go to see the empire state building ? _eos
_go ah ! that sounds interesting . _eos
_go it 's gone with the wind . _eos
_go why do you like it best ? _eos
_go i enjoy the various characters and the plot . _eos
_go well . i like the thom birds best . _eos
_go is it very interesting ? _eos
_go sure . i like the writer 's language , too . _eos
_go if i have a chance , i 'll enjoy the book . _eos
_go would you like to go to the bookshop with me ? _eos
_go that 's a good idea . let 's go ! _eos
_go cool , fellow , what 's the date today , buddy ? _eos
_go it 's ... oh it 's the 1st april , april fool 's day . _eos
_go you forgot all of about it , did n't you ? _eos
_go how can you be so sure ? _eos
_go he knows a lot about law and he 's eloquent , too . _eos
_go yes . are you going to be taking a class from him ? _eos
_go yes , but i have never taken his class before . _eos
_go he is very interesting and challenging . is that what you are looking for ? _eos
_go yes , that 's what i need . _eos
_go he is really clear on what you need to learn to get a good grade . are you willing to study hard ? _eos
_go yes , i guess so . _eos
_go what i really liked about him is that he was an understanding and friendly teacher . do you enjoy that in a teacher ? _eos
_go yes , i had a teacher like that before . _eos
_go did you know that he has 20 years teaching experience ? _eos
_go no , i did n't , but that could be a good thing . _eos
_go well , take a look at everything and figure out what is best for you . good luck ! _eos
_go i 'm not feeling well . i 'm very nervous . _eos
_go take it easy . we are going to have our own baby . you should be happy . _eos
_go yeah , i know . _eos
_go the doctors and the nurses will help you . and i will be waiting for you right here , praying for you and our baby . _eos
_go thank you , dear . i feel better now . _eos
_go yeah . it 's been raining a lot these days . _eos
_go i have been watching a lot of videos at home because of the constant rain . _eos
_go have you heard when it 's supposed to get better ? _eos
_go i saw the weather report , and it 's going to rain for the next eight days . _eos
_go that sucks so much . what are we going to do ? _eos
_go i 'm getting pretty bored . we should do something despite the rain . _eos
_go i 'm with you . what do you have in mind ? _eos
_go i have n't been to the mall in a long time . let 's go there . _eos
_go that sounds good . they have a movie theatre there , so if we get bored , we can watch a movie . _eos
_go great . i 'll stop by your place now . _eos
_go ok . do n't forget to bring your umbrella . the rain can start up again anytime . _eos
_go professor donald , are you giving your advanced geology course again next semester ? _eos
_go yes , i am applying on it . _eos
_go i wonder if i could enroll in it . i know it is a graduate course and i 'm a junior , but ... _eos
_go are n't you a bit young ? i have a lot of qualified seniors to take the course and they usually have a hard time keeping up . _eos
_go i know , but geology of the american west is my major interest and i have done a large reading in the field . _eos
_go well , if you think you are ready , i 'll let you enroll . _eos
_go oh , thanks , professor donald . this is really very nice of you . _eos
_go come on , do n't be so dramatic ! i 'm sure everything is going to work out just fine . _eos
_go you think so ? oh , no ! how can he do this to me ? i 'm sure he 's cheating on me ! why else would n't he call ? _eos
_go but , you two are on a break . theoretically he can do whatever he likes . _eos
_go he 's the love of my life ! i 've really messed this up . _eos
_go come on , hon . pull yourself together . it 's going to be alright . _eos
_go but i ... i still love him ! and it 's all my fault ! i ca n't believe how immature and selfish i was being . i mean , he is a firefighter , it 's not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . i 've totally messed this up ! _eos
_go you know what , veronica , i think you should make the first step . i 'm sure he 'll forgive you ... _eos
_go no , this is not gon na happen ! i ... i 've ruined everything ... _eos
_go do you hear something ? _eos
_go to be honest , i was just dumped . _eos
_go oh , i 'm sorry to hear that . you can go on a holiday to cheer you up . _eos
_go no , thanks . i 'm not in the mood for traveling . _eos
_go come on . a trip will do you good . are you doing anything this weekend ? _eos
_go i was planning on doing a lot of wallowing . _eos
_go well , my friends and i are planning on going to shangri - la on saturday . do you want to come with us ? _eos
_go where is that ? _eos
_go not very far from here . we 'll fly . it 's about one and a half hours . _eos
_go what 's there to see ? _eos
_go there is a large canyon , vast grasslands , ancient forests and mountain lakes . _eos
_go oh , sounds nice . _eos
_go yes , the scenery there is breathtaking . i have some pictures at home . you can come over and take a look if you like . _eos
_go ok . then i can make up my mind . _eos
_go yes , just once . _eos
_go what was the reason ? _eos
_go i once played truant when i was in college because i intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster - hit areas in sichuan . _eos
_go oh , i ca n't . i have a date ! _eos
_go really ? wow with who ? _eos
_go this girl i 've been chatting with for the past couple of months . she 's really cool and she 's driving over here this weekend . _eos
_go wait a minute , you mean you met her online ? _eos
_go yeah ! i signed up for a website called match @ . com and it is great ! you fill in all your details and preferences , like if you are a smoker or if you have any pets . then you find people that have similar characteristics and you can email them or chat . _eos
_go that is kind of weird ! what if she is a psycho or something like that ? _eos
_go it 's the same as meeting people anywhere and dating them ! i am just tired of going to bars or being set up for dates by my friends ! i think this is a really cool alternative , especially if you are a bit shy . _eos
_go i guess it does seem logical . i 'll have to check it out ! _eos
_go stay for dinner with us . _eos
_go i 'm afraid i ca n't . i have a dinner party at seven tonight . you see , i am going to england the day after tomorrow . _eos
_go well , i wo n't keep you then . it was very nice of you to come to see me . _eos
_go it has been a pleasure . goodbye . _eos
_go goodbye . thank you again for coming . _eos
_go sure ! are you okay ? you seem a bit worried . what 's on your mind ? _eos
_go we need to talk . _eos
_go okay ... _eos
_go i 've been thinking , and well , i think we need to start seeing other people . _eos
_go what ? why ? i mean , we 've had our ups and downs , and we have the occasional disagreement , but we 're happy together , are n't we ? _eos
_go that 's just it , i 'm not happy anymore , tim . it 's not you , it 's me . i know that i can be hard to deal with , and you are a great guy ! you are the type of guy that any woman would kill for ! _eos
_go so , what are you saying ? you 're breaking up with me because i 'm perfect ? _eos
_go tim , you are too good for me . you deserve someone who can make you smile and make you happy the way that you made me happy . oh , i could say that i 'll be all you need , but that would be a lie . i know i 'd only hurt you , i know i 'd only make you cry . _eos
_go baby , come on . do n't do this to me ! whatever it is , we can work it out . just give me another chance ! i know that we can get through this , but we got ta stick together ! do n't leave me . _eos
_go i ca n't , tim . i hope someday you can find some way to understand i 'm only doing this for you . i do n't really wanna go but , deep in my heart i know this is the kindest thing to do . _eos
_go laura ... _eos
_go here are your keys . i 'll send my sister to pick up the rest of my things next week . i 'm sorry , tim . i wish you all the best , and i hope that one day we can meet again . i 'll always love you . goodbye . _eos
_go what 's wrong , honey ? take it easy . _eos
_go i am tired of doing that boring work . i just repeat doing counting everyday . it 's so terrible . _eos
_go me too . but i think we can do something else for a change . _eos
_go you know i work with my professional knowledge not passion . sometimes i do n't know what the meaning of working is ? _eos
_go but you did a good job . you always perform the best in our company . _eos
_go yes , that 's in the past . maybe i need to go to my psychologist for help . _eos
_go perhaps you 've just tired and you need a vacation . _eos
_go i was full of ambitions before . but now i have no aim for my career . _eos
_go maybe we should keep on studying to enrich our knowledge and make our life exciting . _eos
_go that sounds interesting . but i do n't know how to do that . _eos
_go how about a training course ? _eos
_go a training course ? that must be costly . _eos
_go but it 's worth it . maybe it can get us into a good mood and also helps us learn something to use for the future . _eos
_go ok , let 's have a try . _eos
_go ok . _eos
_go oh , yes . you ? _eos
_go yes . what did you think of it ? _eos
_go i thought it was better than the others - i really liked it . what did you think of it ? _eos
_go yes , i liked it , too . it was exciting , but not over the top . do you know what i mean ? _eos
_go mmm . that 's what i thought too . i really liked the car chase , and the opening credit sequence was very exciting . and i always enjoy watching pierce brosnan . _eos
_go oh , yes . he 's brilliant . did you like the title song ? _eos
_go not as much as last time , actually . what 's the name of the american actor who was in the supporting role ? _eos
_go hum , edward norton , or something like that . did you like him ? _eos
_go yes . he was excellent . they worked well together , do n't you think ? _eos
_go i do n't know . i think the woman was better . she provided a good love interest . lucky james bond ! _eos
_go yes ! _eos
_go what 's her figure ? _eos
_go perfect , and i like her charming eyes too . _eos
_go what 's the color of her eyes ? _eos
_go dark blue . _eos
_go i 'm going to buy a cd . _eos
_go why not listen to music online ? _eos
_go then i will have to pay quite a lot to listen to music on line , is n't it ? _eos
_go you can audition music on line , and you can audition it off line after downloading it , so you need n't pay for it . _eos
_go i have downloaded one , but it still ca n't be listened . _eos
_go in order to listen to music , you must have the necessary software . _eos
_go can you recommend some to me ? _eos
_go certainly . realplayer is a good . _eos
_go can i download it ? _eos
_go yes , but you need install it after downloading so that you can use it . _eos
_go i 'll try it tonight . _eos
_go yeah , richard said something to me that i did n't appreciate . _eos
_go oh , no . i know how insensitive he can be . what has he done now ? _eos
_go he asked me how long it took me to learn english . _eos
_go but , you were born and raised in california ! _eos
_go yeah , but i get that sometimes . it does n't matter how many generations my family has lived in the u . s . , we 'll always be foreigners in their eyes . _eos
_go what a racist ! how can you stand working with the guy ? _eos
_go you know , richard is n't such a bad guy . he made the comment out of ignorance , not malice . _eos
_go so , what did you say when he asked you how long it took you to learn english ? _eos
_go i told him 28 years . and , he knows i 'm 28 years old since i just celebrated my birthday last week . he was puzzled for a minute , and then he got it . _eos
_go are you sure he really got the message ? _eos
_go yeah , i 'm pretty sure since i then asked him how long it took him to learn english . _eos
_go that 's hilarious ! what did he say ? _eos
_go he said , ' 36 years , ' and we both laughed about it . he apologized and now , it 's all good . _eos
_go i 'm glad . i bet he wo n't make that mistake again . _eos
_go yes , it 's a way to commemorate a great ancient romantic poet , and the race is a symbol of the attempt to save him . _eos
_go i see . did they succeed in the end ? _eos
_go of course not . he drowned . _eos
_go i would like to use a computer . _eos
_go do you have your library card ? _eos
_go i sure do . _eos
_go there is a wait for the computers . _eos
_go that 's all right . _eos
_go you need to print your name on this list . _eos
_go okay . now what ? _eos
_go once a computer is available , i will let you know . _eos
_go how am i supposed to log on to the computer ? _eos
_go all you do is type in the number on the back of your card . _eos
_go that 's it ? thank you very much . _eos
_go to be honest , i 'm really fed up with work at the moment . i need a break ! _eos
_go are you doing anything this weekend ? _eos
_go i have to work on saturday all day ! i really hate my job ! _eos
_go are you available on sunday ? _eos
_go yes , that 's my only day off until thursday . _eos
_go ok , well , my friends and i are planning on going to the beach on sunday . we tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . do you want to come with us ? _eos
_go that 'd be fantastic ! which beach are you going to ? _eos
_go it 's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city . _eos
_go what should i bring with me ? _eos
_go we 've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you 'll have to bring your own sunlounger . _eos
_go i can just use my beach towel . i love lazing around in the sun . _eos
_go do you like surfing ? _eos
_go i 've actually never tired . do you have a surfboard ? _eos
_go we 've got a few . i can teach you how to surf on sunday . it 'll be fun ! _eos
_go i ca n't wait ! it sounds like we 're going to have a great time . how much money should i bring ? _eos
_go you 'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . my friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money . _eos
_go ok , where and when should i meet you ? _eos
_go we 'll pick you up at your place at noon . be there or be square ! _eos
_go it 'll take us all some time to get used to the change . _eos
_go why do you say that ? i think you 're making a lot of progress . _eos
_go no , i 'm not . i try and try and i still ca n't speak it very well . _eos
_go learning any language takes a lot of effort . but do n't give up . why do n't we practise those dialogues together ? _eos
_go good idea . that might help . _eos
_go you are interested in other people 's business , are n't you ? _eos
_go does he mean i am inquisitive or i 'm noisy ? _eos
_go yes . _eos
_go ok , please . _eos
_go my wife wants to take the children to go shopping , where is the best place to go ? _eos
_go i would recommend the mall , it 's about 20 minutes , drive to the south in a taxi . it has a wide range of shops and restaurants . _eos
_go thank you . also , we 'd like to do some sightseeing while we 're in town . can you recommend some local attractions ? _eos
_go how old are your children ? _eos
_go i have a 10 - year - old boy and a 6 - year - old girl . _eos
_go i would recommend a day at the zoo . it 's fun for all the family . there is also a water park just outside the city if you would like a day trip . _eos
_go it sounds marvelous . thank you for your help . _eos
_go easter 's a good day for reunions . the family goes to church together . _eos
_go and after church they come here for lunch ? _eos
_go yup , a big potluck buffet . and then - notice there are no children around ? _eos
_go yeah , what 's up with that ? _eos
_go the kids wait in the house while the grownups hide these . hide away , yi - jun ! _eos
_go well , i 've been looking forward to seeing you . _eos
_go what can i get you ? _eos
_go i 'd love a gin and tonic . _eos
_go sure , what 's the author 's name , please . _eos
_go i ca n't remember that clearly . it probably be charles ... _eos
_go charles dickens ? _eos
_go no , no , no . i 'm not interested in literature . _eos
_go ok , do you know the title of the book ? _eos
_go oh , sorry . i 'm always absent - minded . i remember that i 've put a note in my pocket . _eos
_go so , show me the note please . _eos
_go i ca n't find it now . _eos
_go oh , such bad luck , sir . can you please name the category of the book ? _eos
_go let me see . it 's not fiction . it 's biography . _eos
_go ok , i 'll search it for you . a moment , please . _eos
_go thanks . _eos
_go i look at many things , attendance , quizzes , and tests . _eos
_go what is the most important factor ? _eos
_go obviously i look for improvement as we go along , but i would like you to do your best from the beginning . _eos
_go how can we keep track of our grades ? _eos
_go the final and midterm are 40 percent of your grade ; homework , attendance , and quizzes total 60 percent . _eos
_go what if we ca n't get to school ? _eos
_go you can only miss one class without penalty . _eos
_go if we have a major problem , will you let us know ? _eos
_go i will be letting you know during the year if you have a major problem . _eos
_go have you thought about the cost ? _eos
_go there is that . _eos
_go i believe it 'll be very expensive . _eos
_go i would like to return some books . _eos
_go i 'll take them . _eos
_go here you go . _eos
_go these books were due two weeks ago . _eos
_go yeah . i totally forgot they were due . _eos
_go you will need to pay late fees on these books . _eos
_go how much are the late fees ? _eos
_go the fee is 25 cents every day . _eos
_go i have to pay 25 cents a day ? _eos
_go and that 's for each book that is late . _eos
_go that should n't be a problem . _eos
_go it sure is ! the water looks so nice ! anchor the boat for a little while . i 'm going to take a dip . _eos
_go why are you doggy - paddling ? i taught you how to swim ! do your breast stroke ! _eos
_go i get too tired ! i 'll just backstroke , it 's easier ! _eos
_go try kicking your legs more . that 's good . do n't go out too far ! _eos
_go it 's fine . jump in ! _eos
_go kathy ! get back here ! i see a shark ! _eos
_go ahahah ! ! ! help me ! help ! bring the boat closer ! the shark is coming straight towards me ! _eos
_go it 's right under you ! kathy ! ! ! _eos
_go my husband and i got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses . but then we had three parties to celebrate . _eos
_go three parties ? that 's quite a lot . that must have been expensive ! _eos
_go well , since my husband and i are from two different countries , and we live in a third country , we decided to have one in each country . it was n't actually that expensive . _eos
_go were your parents upset that they were n't there to see you get married ? _eos
_go i would have liked them to be there , but they could n't afford to fly out to see us , and we could n't afford to fly out to see them , so they understood . _eos
_go did your husband 's family get to meet your family ? _eos
_go my husband 's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown , so that was great . some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions , but we agreed t _eos
_go that makes sense . did you go on a honeymoon ? _eos
_go we waited until our one - year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to africa . _eos
_go you really did n't have a very traditional wedding , did you ? _eos
_go not at all , but we do n't have a very traditional marriage either , so it suited us perfectly ! _eos
_go i 'd love to , the movies are smash hit . _eos
_go then let 's go in . _eos
_go i ca n't . i 'm waiting for paul , but he 's late . _eos
_go i 'll say the movie 's starting in the minute . _eos
_go i know . i wonder what 's keeping him . _eos
_go looks like he wo n't show up . he 's done this before , has n't he ? _eos
_go yeah , a number of times . _eos
_go what 's he trying to pull anyway . _eos
_go i do n't know . but this is definitely the last straw . _eos
_go maybe you should start seeing someone else . _eos
_go you said it . ok , let 's go in , sandy . _eos
_go i 'm going to visit my brother . he 's just had a baby . he lives in minneapolis . _eos
_go and how long do you you plan to remain in the united states ? _eos
_go i 'll be here for approximately three weeks . see , here 's my return ticket for the twenty - sixth of march . _eos
_go and , who is sponsoring your trip ? _eos
_go my brother , here , this is an invitation letter from him . i will stay with him and his family in their home . _eos
_go alright , tell me about the ties you have to your home country . _eos
_go well , i own a house . actually , i 'm leaving my dog there with my neighbors . i have a car at home , and oh , my job ! i 'm employed by tornal as an engineer . actually , i only have three weeks'vacation , so i have to go back to work at the end of march . _eos
_go and what evidence do you have that you are financially independent ? _eos
_go well , i do have assets in my country . like i said , i own a house , and see , here 's a bank statement showing my investments , and my bank balance . _eos
_go i 'm sorry , sir , we can not grant you a b2 visa at this time , instead , you are granted a resident visa ! congratulations , you are the millionth person to apply for a visa ! you win ! congratulations ! _eos
_go well , i am a bit out of shape . i 'm thinking about getting some exercises to keep fit . _eos
_go oh , that 's good news for us . _eos
_go so what do you provide ? _eos
_go first of all , we 'll design a custom - made work - out plan according to your habits . _eos
_go how can you get that done ? _eos
_go well , we give each of our customers a personal trainer who is qualified . and he will give you a fitness assessment and then come up with the work - out plan for your needs . _eos
_go what else ? _eos
_go since everyone is different , your personal trainer will find you a suitable type of exercise equipment and teach you all the techniques to help you achieve your fitness level and goal . _eos
_go sounds pretty good . what about the charge ? _eos
_go that depends . we offer membership for one month , half a year and one year . _eos
_go maybe one month . just have a try first . not too tough at the beginning . _eos
_go wise decision . you 'll find it 's totally worth it . _eos
_go not really . i could take it or leave it . _eos
_go not me . i have to have my tv and watch whatever comes on . _eos
_go how can you do that ? _eos
_go my name is jung min . what 's your name ? _eos
_go my name is jessica . it 's nice to meet you . _eos
_go yes . it 's nice to meet you too . are you a new student too ? _eos
_go no . i 'm a sophomore . i take it you are a new student ? _eos
_go yeah . it 's pretty exciting to be here . _eos
_go have fun while it lasts . the excitement wears off real quick . especially after you see how much homework you get . where are you from ? _eos
_go i 'm from korea . my parents wanted me to go to an american university , so i came here . _eos
_go i have never been to korea . i 've been to japan before , but never korea . _eos
_go why were you in japan ? _eos
_go my father thought it would be a good experience to take a vacation to a different country . he 's so into learning about different cultures . _eos
_go that 's pretty cool . _eos
_go i thought it would have been more fun if i went without my parents . _eos
_go well , if you ever want to visit korea , i would be happy to show you around . _eos
_go thanks for the offer . i 'll keep that in mind . oh , the professor is coming . we 'll talk more after class . _eos
_go ok . _eos
_go who ? _eos
_go john smith , the escaped criminal . _eos
_go that bad egg , who took the low road since he was a boy . _eos
_go i think i must report to the cops . _eos
_go ok . _eos
_go eh , so so . _eos
_go and this one ? too flashy ? _eos
_go nah , not too flashy . _eos
_go hug ! and this sweater from my aunt ? is n't it hideous ? _eos
_go i guess . _eos
_go are you even listening ? i 'm trying to have a conversation with you . _eos
_go and i 'm trying to watch the game , but you 're yapping on about your new clothes ! _eos
_go well i have to decide which gifts to keep and which to exchange for better ones when i go to the boxing day sales this afternoon ! _eos
_go well could you do me the favor of making this quick ? it 's the third quarter and you 've been blabbering on since the first ! _eos
_go oh , your precious game . you watch the same game every year , and each year your beloved hometown team loses by at least three goals ! _eos
_go oh no you did n't . you did n't just insult the sals - bury seals , did you ? why do n't you just . just go and return all of those stupid clothes and not come back until the sales are over ? _eos
_go i might just ! enjoy your stupid game ! _eos
_go yes , fine . i had something wrong with my stomach . i wo n't go into detail , but it was n't serious . _eos
_go i really dislike going to a doctor or to a hospital . _eos
_go i think most people are a little nervous about it . i was really very , very nervous just before i had the operation , but the anaesthetist gave me an anaesthetic and the next thing i remember was waking up after the operation . _eos
_go it must have really hurt afterwards . _eos
_go well , the nurse game me plenty of painkillers , but it did feel uncomfortable . i was n't permitted to eat anything for 48 hours . that was the worse thing . _eos
_go i bet you were ready for a thick juicy steak when you got out of hospital . _eos
_go i certainly was ! however , the doctor gave me a list of food i could n't eat for another 72 hours , and steak was on the list ! _eos
_go is there any pain now ? _eos
_go no , not at all . i stopped taking painkillers after a couple of days . _eos
_go did they take good care of you in the hospital ? _eos
_go oh , yes . the nurse were very kind , though they were strict about what i could drink . in the end , i just drank water and nothing else . everyone was very professional and i actually enjoyed some aspects of my stay . _eos
_go i had a fantastic time . _eos
_go everything goes well , but i am thinking about quitting my current job . _eos
_go why ? you 're not satisfied anymore ? _eos
_go i just sense . but i can not grow anymore . my boss is not really supporting me . i am interested in some positions in other jv companies , but i need to do some more in - depth research before i send my application letters out . _eos
_go that is important . doing research on a company you are interested in will definitely help your application . _eos
_go certainly , it is very nice talking with you . but i really have to go now . catch you later . _eos
_go ok , good luck to you . _eos
_go yeah . but he soon feel regretted for it . _eos
_go but he seems to be very happy with rose . _eos
_go he is more nice than wise . _eos
_go yes , is that you , allen ? _eos
_go yes , how are you doing ? _eos
_go not bad . _eos
_go say i 've got two tickets for the concert this evening . would you like to come with me ? _eos
_go sure . thank you very much . _eos
_go then i 'll pick you up at six thirty . ok ? _eos
_go ok , see you . _eos
_go see you . _eos
_go yeah , i 'm worried . if it 's like this tomorrow , our big outdoor party will have to be canceled . _eos
_go let 's hope it clears up . _eos
_go yeah , i 'm afraid so . _eos
_go if there 's one thing that bugs me , it 's her critical attitude . _eos
_go yes , it is annoying . _eos
_go nothing particular . but , ... _eos
_go what 's the matter ? _eos
_go i , i do n't know how to explain it to you . _eos
_go go ahead . it 's nothing serious . we are good friends , are n't we ? _eos
_go yes , of course . but i 'm afraid i ca n't tell you . _eos
_go how do you do ? nice to meet you , ms . smith . i 'm jack stevens from the marketing department . here is my card . _eos
_go it 's nice to meet you , mr . stevens . _eos
_go please call me jack . have a seat , please . _eos
_go thank you . _eos
_go you 're welcome . _eos
_go that 's all right . _eos
_go not much . just sitting here eating some chinese food . is that the paper ? why do n't you open it and tell me my horoscope ? _eos
_go ok , wait a minute ... let 's see . i 'm a taurus , and it says , mars is in the third house , and is soon to eclipse venus . i do n't know what that means , but then it says , your charm and drive will win others over to your way of thinking . remember to be positive . sounds good to me . _eos
_go what about gemini ? what 's the prediction ? _eos
_go since mercury has crossed paths with jupiter , your fortunes are falling . bad luck will follow you today , and you will lose that which you value . be careful . _eos
_go that sounds bad ! i 'm really worried , what should i do ? maybe i should go home and stay in the rest of the day . _eos
_go but we have a date tonight ! you ca n't stay at home because of a stupid horoscope . _eos
_go that sounds great . where are you going ? _eos
_go i think we can go to the river , go around and have supper . _eos
_go what should i bring ? _eos
_go nothing . just wear comfortable clothes and good shoes for walking . we 'll bring everything . _eos
_go i feel confident of his ability to cure my daughter 's disease . _eos
_go how can you be so sure ? _eos
_go i can tell form the way he spoke to us . _eos
_go never believe his words . _eos
_go i guess we should invite him . i just hope he does n't start talking about sylvester stallone and arnold schwarzenegger again . _eos
_go oh , come on ! the game is better with three people . anyway , if we do n't ask him to play , he 'll be mad . _eos
_go yeah , you 're right . we 'll never hear the end of it . _eos
_go personally , i 'm not for it . i feel it 's bad for kids to watch . _eos
_go but kids like watching things like that . it 's just for fun , would't you say ? _eos
_go if you ask me , i have to disagree . something should n't be watched for fun . _eos
_go yes , i am . _eos
_go shall we have dinner together ? _eos
_go do you have a special restaurant in mind ? _eos
_go yes , i do . i know a place that has excellent food . _eos
_go ok . i 'll be happy to join you . _eos
_go the board has been considering introducing flex time . _eos
_go good news . ah , what if be even better if alternative work place is provided . _eos
_go then our entire job could be done by telecommuting . _eos
_go yes . _eos
_go where did you learn ? _eos
_go i learned in college . _eos
_go you speak really well . _eos
_go thank you . _eos
_go how long have you been in the u . s . ? _eos
_go 3 weeks . _eos
_go is your wife with you ? _eos
_go yes , she just got here yesterday . _eos
_go have you been to california before ? _eos
_go no . i 've never been there . _eos
_go have you ever been to las vegas ? _eos
_go yes . i went there once on a business trip . _eos
_go i 'm very pleased with their performances . timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds . that 's very fast for a kid his age . _eos
_go he 's not very good at the long jump though , is he ? _eos
_go he 's not bad . he can jump a distance of over four meters . i think he just prefers running to jumping . jimmy 's very good at the high jump . he can jump over two meters . again , that 's fine for someone his age . _eos
_go two meters ? that means that the high jump bar is above his head ! are any of them good at long - distance running ? _eos
_go the longest race we run is the 1500 meters . a few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes . _eos
_go how are they at swimming ? _eos
_go they 're ok . i ask them to swim 500 meters each day . that 's 20 lengths of the swimming pool . they 're not very fast , but that 's ok . i just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape . _eos
_go kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters . _eos
_go i 'd be afraid to jump from that height ! _eos
_go i think that these kinds have n't learnt to be afraid yet . she started diving from a lower height , but she soon wanted to go higher . _eos
_go it seems that they really enjoy trying to go faster , higher and further . _eos
_go yes , it is . we 've been dating for over 7 years . we have decided to get married on a special day and we think august 8th , 2008 is a red - letter day . _eos
_go good for you ! it sounds like you 've done a lot of planning in a very short time . _eos
_go yes , there is a lot of to be taken care of --- wedding photos , wedding dress , catering , transport , hotel , etc ... _eos
_go is everything ready now ? _eos
_go almost . the only thing that is n't ready is the hotel . as a lot of people have chosen that day to get married , it is hard to find a hotel that is n't too expensive . _eos
_go have you tried the peninsula palace beijing ? my wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job . _eos
_go yes , we called , but it is booked up . the only choice is the regent beijing but we have n't made up our minds yet . _eos
_go it 's an excellent hotel . a friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive . _eos
_go that 's why we want to have a look at other hotels . we do n't want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception . _eos
_go i guess you 're right . i can help you ask other hotels . i am sure there are probably some available . _eos
_go thank you . _eos
_go my pleasure . _eos
_go sorry , i thought you knew . _eos
_go but you should have told me you were in love with her . _eos
_go did n't i ? _eos
_go you know you did n't . _eos
_go well , i 'm telling you now . _eos
_go yes , but you might have told me before . _eos
_go i did n't think you 'd be interested . _eos
_go you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you were going to marry her ? _eos
_go sorry , i did n't think it mattered . _eos
_go oh , you men ! you 're all the same . _eos
_go yes . you 've done a good job . but there 's one thing . you should narrow down your topic . _eos
_go what about water pollution instead of pollution ? _eos
_go i 'm fine . thank you . _eos
_go do you need anything ? _eos
_go i need you to help me . _eos
_go what can i do for you ? _eos
_go i am looking for an article in a newspaper . _eos
_go did you check the periodicals ? _eos
_go i did n't even bother to think of that . _eos
_go i 'll show you where to find your article . _eos
_go i get lost in this library . _eos
_go it 's right this way . _eos
_go thanks a lot for your help . _eos
_go tonight ? i 'm afraid i ca n't . i 've promised mark to go to the gym . can we make it tomorrow ? _eos
_go no problem . let 's say 6:30 p . m . at the royal restaurant , ok ? _eos
_go all right . see you tomorrow night . _eos
_go i 'm very busy these days . it seems i can never finish my work . _eos
_go well , take it easy ! do n't let it get on top of you . _eos
_go i 'll try . i 'm under a lot of pressure right now . _eos
_go why do n't you take a few days off ? _eos
_go i ca n't . i am really behind of my work . _eos
_go yes , i can , but not very well . _eos
_go where did you learn it ? _eos
_go at school . and i 'm still learning it now . _eos
_go how long have you been learning it ? _eos
_go about three years . _eos
_go can you speak any other languages ? _eos
_go i 'm afraid not . _eos
_go good afternoon , mary . how 's business ? _eos
_go not bad , thanks . _eos
_go god ! do n't you think they should get you an assistant ? _eos
_go yes , they were supposed to , but so far nobody 's turned up , and i have to do the work alone . this is the first break i 've had all day . _eos
_go they 're really running you into the ground . why do n't you ask for some time off ? you could take a long weekend and have a good rest . _eos
_go i 'm afraid i ca n't before i finish this project . _eos
_go you 'd better pay more attention to your health . _eos
_go i will , thanks for your concern . _eos
_go you 're welcome . _eos
_go what happened ? _eos
_go my som was lost . i told him to stand rooted to the spot when i went shopping , but he ignored it . _eos
_go how did you find him at last ? _eos
_go it was the police wo helped me to do that . _eos
_go it must have taught you a lesson this time . _eos
_go why ? i think it 's convenient and good . _eos
_go no . the decoration has been out - of - date . my friends have a whole kitchen now . it 's modern . _eos
_go why should we run after the fashion ? _eos
_go i am not running after the fashion . i just want a very beautiful and clean kitchen . _eos
_go i 'm crazy about it . it makes me very excited . _eos
_go then tell me what 's good about it . _eos
_go it ca n't be expressed by words . _eos
_go i have no idea . maybe she had a fight with her husband . _eos
_go wow , fantastic . i like the font and color for his name . it is creative yet personal . _eos
_go yes , it is a bold design . people will believe he can make an illustration as an impressive as a business card . it just stands out from those plain and standard ones used by government people or other big private and public organizations . _eos
_go i agree . business cards are great tools for promoting personal business . it wo n't take much time to design an amazing card , but it can make a big difference among the crowd . and you 'll always notice it from your collection . for they have outspoken colors , own design and the sizes are not always according the mainstream business card . i wish to have one like this . but for sure our company has its own corporate design which all employees have to follow . _eos
_go oh , yes . my wife bought it for me yesterday . hmm , you look nice in that yellow dress . yellow suits you really well . _eos
_go maybe . several people have suggested that i get more yellow clothes . they say the color suits me because i have a fair complexion . _eos
_go that 's right . you know , pink , green and black could also be good for you . actually , i think that all colors are okay for a person with your complexion . it 's just that different colors can give people different impressions . for example , black could make you look mature , while pink could make you look young and energetic . _eos
_go thank you for your compliments . it sounds like you 're a clothing expert . _eos
_go well , compared with my wife , i 'm just a beginner . _eos
_go what ? why do we have to do that ? _eos
_go well , at the start of the spring we usually have more daylight in the mornings and less in the afternoon . this is basically due to our position on the planet and the rotation of the earth . in any case , to take better advantage of the daylight available , we compensate by moving our clocks forward one hour . _eos
_go i see . that 's convenient ! i never understood things like this , such as gmt . i never know what time zone we are in or when to change my clock ! _eos
_go that just stands for greenwich mean time . here in california , we are in pacific standard time , that is eight time zones west of greenwich . remember when we were in beijing ? well , then we were in china standard time , and that 's eight time zones east of greenwich ! _eos
_go that 's why it was so weird traveling from beijing to la ! because of the huge time difference , even though we left beijing at noon and flew for more than eight hours , we still arrived in la the same day at noon ! it 's like we went back in time ! _eos
_go yes , i 'd love to . it 's interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good . _eos
_go i like watching it for the fashion . i like to see what the ladies are wearing . of course , the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo . _eos
_go sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours . which films do you think will win awards this year ? _eos
_go i 'm really not sure . usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony , but this year there are several contenders . _eos
_go you 're right . this year should be much more exciting than usual . what 's you favourite award category ? _eos
_go you might think this strange , but i like the category for best foreign language film . _eos
_go it 's nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on hollywood . i like the best actor and actress . _eos
_go we have two cleaning ladies . but both of them have received little education . _eos
_go most cleaning ladies are illiterate . but some of them do a very nice job . _eos
_go but i actually dislike another lady . she is more capable and seems to have ideas of her own . but the trouble is she is a backseat driver with some of us . she would tell you what to do and where to put things . _eos
_go there are parades in many cities and people fly the national flags from almost every public building . _eos
_go what kinds of parades are there ? _eos
_go the parades are usually military ones , but sometimes there are procession of people carrying flags and singing patriotic songs . what do you do on national day in your country ? _eos
_go we do n't have a national day . _eos
_go really ? that 's unusual . _eos
_go i guess it is . most countries have on , but we do n't . _eos
_go actually , even though we have parades , most people just use the national day holiday to visit family or go shopping . in the evening , many people watch special tv shows which celebrate national day . _eos
_go no , not this weekend . i have too much work to do . _eos
_go where do your parents live ? _eos
_go my father lives in washington dc . _eos
_go how about your mother ? _eos
_go my mother died two years ago . _eos
_go oh , i am sorry to hear that . is your father still working ? _eos
_go no , he 's retired . _eos
_go do you have any family here ? _eos
_go yes , two of my cousins live here and my aunt and uncle live about 30 miles from here . _eos
_go do you have any brothers or sisters ? _eos
_go yes , i have two brothers who live in new york and a sister who lives in boston . _eos
_go do you see them a lot ? _eos
_go not as much as i 'd like to . usually just on holidays like thanksgiving and christmas . _eos
_go not great . it 's a kind of boring . _eos
_go really ? i heard it was supposed to be great . _eos
_go yes , me too . but i 'm disappointed . _eos
_go nothing . _eos
_go why do you look unhappy ? _eos
_go i 'm rather disappointed at not being able to see my best friend off . _eos
_go oh , cheer up . he 'll understand you . _eos
_go i hope so . _eos
_go really ? _eos
_go but i think henry is a backroom boy . he always helps her with her study . _eos
_go you 're right . _eos
_go that is awesome . congratulation ! i know you can make it . _eos
_go thanks . let 's go for a celebration this evening . are you free ? _eos
_go yes . wait for me at the cafe down my office building . see 5 pm , ok ? _eos
_go no problem . see you ! _eos
_go see you ! _eos
_go i do ! my favorites are mexican , thai , and indian . _eos
_go really ? have you ever tried moroccan ? _eos
_go i ca n't say that i have . what are the basic ingredients ? _eos
_go i do n't know . a friend of mine said i should try it . _eos
_go do you know where a moroccan restaurant is ? _eos
_go as a matter of fact , he gave me this address . _eos
_go let 's go there for lunch ! i 'm up for an adventure ! _eos
_go but not as good as your mother 's , right ? _eos
_go actually , it 's better ... _eos
_go what ? are you kidding ? _eos
_go no . it was the only dish she was n't good at . so we could use you as the new head chef ... _eos
_go oh , uncle giovanni . that 's wonderful ! thank you ! thank you ! _eos
_go ok , ok . get back to work . there 's someone waiting for you in the kitchen ... _eos
_go five . my father , mother , brother , sister - in - law and me . _eos
_go is your brother older or younger than you ? _eos
_go he is five years older than me , he got married last sunday . my brother and my sister - in - law are the same age . _eos
_go i am going to a movie theater . you know there is a new action film produced by hollywood . a thriller , really . _eos
_go another terror film ? there is too much terror and violence in the films . do you like seeing such a picture ? _eos
_go i do n't really like seeing bloody frames , but i appreciate the lifelike frames simulated with the highly skillful special effects . _eos
_go no , i did n't . and you ? was it good ? _eos
_go yes . i did . i enjoyed it a lot . there was a folk singer , a violinist and a pianist . _eos
_go how much was the ticket ? _eos
_go i only paid two dollars for mine . _eos
_go it 's unbelievable ! they are only married for one month . then who is at fault ? _eos
_go mary said she could n't put up with tom , for he fell in love with another woman . _eos
_go do you think they 'll become reconciled ? _eos
_go no , i do n't think so . she said she would rather be single than cope with an unhappy marriage . _eos
_go what a shame ! their marriage is really a mistake . _eos
_go sure . beijingers are distinguished for their warmth and hospitality . _eos
_go as far as you could see , is dining at a chinese table a distinct experience ? to what extent does it differ from that in your homeland ? _eos
_go to begin with , i have to use chopsticks . _eos
_go but you look quite proficient in using them now . _eos
_go certainly . after all , i 've been here for two years . it 's not much uphill work for a foreigner to get used to chinese dinner utensils . though , i do feel hazy about how to behave appropriately at a ch _eos
_go yes , table etiquette . there are a multitude of rules that foreigners might never know until they were told . some practices even appear somewhat awkward or rude to westerners , while they are the norm i _eos
_go anything strang about that ? _eos
_go maybe you should have placed them horizontally over your bowl or plate . they resemble two incense sticks used at sacrifices . it 's very inauspicious , and might enrage all present . _eos
_go oh , sorry ! there 's a long story even with a mere pair of sticks . _eos
_go do n't be so angry . it 's passed anyway . _eos
_go i ca n't forget it . _eos
_go you 'd better cool yourself down first . _eos
_go how many credits for each course ? _eos
_go three , you also should take two three - credit - course in education department . _eos
_go thank you , sir , i 'm sure i will . _eos
_go me too . _eos
_go why do you hate to go outside ? _eos
_go i meet too many jerks . _eos
_go i agree . _eos
_go this city is full of jerks . _eos
_go rude people are everywhere . _eos
_go but what can you do ? _eos
_go you can yell at them . _eos
_go and they will yell back at you . _eos
_go yelling does n't do any good . _eos
_go no . the best thing to do is just stay home . _eos
_go you mean you suspect him . _eos
_go i 'm not sure . i 'll try to prove my feeling . _eos
_go i hope i can do something for you . _eos
_go you do ? _eos
_go yeah , those classics from the great writers . _eos
_go but i find japanese ones better . _eos
_go why does n't he ask her ? _eos
_go he is too scared to ask her . _eos
_go he 's a chicken guy . _eos
_go good morning . _eos
_go what does the paper say ? _eos
_go nothing much -- the same old stuff . a lot of bad news as usual . _eos
_go well , what 's the weather report ? _eos
_go sunny and mild today , cloudy and rainy tomorrow . _eos
_go did they find those bank robbers ? _eos
_go not yet . they were holding two men in ohio , but they let them go . they were n't the criminals after all . _eos
_go what about the sports page ? what were the scores of last night 's games ? _eos
_go here 's the paper ; you can read them yourself . _eos
_go it really depends on when and how long _eos
_go until next weekend . that 's ok . _eos
_go but saturday is my birthday . _eos
_go i think it 's important to do now . we can have a birthday party for you when you come out of the hospital . _eos
_go but it wo n't be on my birthday . _eos
_go but your health is more important . believe me ! _eos
_go why ? they are fine . _eos
_go because they are too violent . some of them are even disgusting . _eos
_go indeed there are bad games . but many of them are good . _eos
_go if boys grow up with computer games , they will surely become bad . _eos
_go come on . things are not so bad . boys can learn to use the computer through games . _eos
_go yes , i am . what 's up ? _eos
_go then would you please go to a dance party with me ? _eos
_go with pleasure . i suppose you dance often . _eos
_go oh , no . as a matter of fact , i have n't danced for a long time . _eos
_go but i am told that you dance wonderfully well . _eos
_go thanks for flattering me . i think you dance a lot , right ? _eos
_go no . just occasionally . _eos
_go what 's your favorite dance ? _eos
_go it 's hard to say , but i do love the foxtrot and waltz . _eos
_go how about rock'n'roll ? _eos
_go to tell you the truth , i do n't like it . it 's too noisy . _eos
_go and the tango ? _eos
_go oh , it 's really beautiful , but i just ca n't do it well . _eos
_go do n't be so modest . i 'm sure you can do it very well . then i 'll meet you at six . is that at all right ? _eos
_go ok . _eos
_go great ! i 'm your lucky fellow then . _eos
_go yes , my friends like to get along with me well . _eos
_go do you have many friends ? _eos
_go yes , i like to make new friends . _eos
_go what do you usually do with them ? _eos
_go we like to get together , chat and enjoy beautiful music . _eos
_go do n't feel like it . i 'm broke . _eos
_go well , we can still do some window shopping , can we ? _eos
_go just look around ? nah , that 's boring . _eos
_go i 'll go by myself then . _eos
_go great idea ! peter , i could use the drink . _eos
_go how about the new bar across the road ? _eos
_go sounds good . the food there is fantastic too . _eos
_go i agree , i had lunch there last week . _eos
_go excellent ! that sounds like a plan . _eos
_go no , i 'm korean . where are you from ? _eos
_go i 'm from america . are you settling in all right ? _eos
_go i 've already found a flat and it 's quite comfortable . what about you ? _eos
_go i live in my uncle 's house . he came here ten years ago . _eos
_go what do you think of the local accent here ? has it been causing you any problems ? _eos
_go i think it 's just a matter of getting used to it . _eos
_go i ca n't agree more . _eos
_go me ? you 're the one who pulled out in front of me ! _eos
_go there was plenty of room for me to pull out . you did n't have to stay in the lane you were in . _eos
_go hey , listen . i had every right to stay in the lane i was in . you were supposed to wait until i passed to pull out . and anyhow , you did n't give me any time to change lanes . all of a sudden -- bang -- there you are right in front of me . _eos
_go i think my arm is broken . _eos
_go sorry about your arm , but it serves you right . you need to learn how to drive . you 're lucky you did n't get killed . and i 'm lucky to be alive too . _eos
_go listen , let 's just wait until the police get here . then we can decide whose fault this accident was . _eos
_go fine with me . i know the laws of the road . i 'm not worried . _eos
_go i have a cell phone in my car . now it 's probably on the floor on the passenger side . why do n't you get it for me , and then i can call the police ? _eos
_go alright . _eos
_go it does n't work . it looks like it 's broken . i need to get to a hospital . you should drive me there . _eos
_go oh , yeah ? it 's better if we make a police report first . then you can go to the hospital . _eos
_go damn it ! i 'm injured here . we could wait all day for the police . _eos
_go well , you 'll just have to wait . i 'm not going to move my car until the police arrive . i 'll go into one of those houses over there and use their phone . do n't worry . you 'll get to the hospital in time . _eos
_go it really hurts . _eos
_go yes , maybe it does . but if you 're going to drive like you did just now , you will have to get used to a little physical pain . you know what i mean ? _eos
_go to hell with you . the accident was your fault . _eos
_go i 'm afraid it was n't . and when the police get here , you will also see that it was n't . but enough of this bickering . i 'm going to go find a phone . do n't move that arm while i 'm gone . alright ? _eos
_go to hell with you . _eos
_go yes . they were open this morning when i came to work . they must 've finished remodeling . why do you want to know ? _eos
_go well , i thought that maybe we could go there for lunch today . that is , if you have n't promised to go with someone else . _eos
_go that 'd be wonderful , peter . but i hope you 're in a better mood than you were this morning . _eos
_go i 'm sorry i was such a grouch . it must 've been the weather . when it rains i get depressed . _eos
_go forget it . i 'll see you at 11:30 am . _eos
_go and ? _eos
_go and she did her best to pull out the thorn in her flesh and the boy lost whatever made him happy . _eos
_go poor child ! _eos
_go what 's your excuse this time ? _eos
_go have i used the one that my sister is sick ? _eos
_go yes , twice last week . _eos
_go are you sure ? i thought i said it was my mother . _eos
_go i do n't think so . but it could 've been . _eos
_go well . you can trust me this time . my sister is definitely sick . i 'm just coming from the hospital . they say she might even die . _eos
_go i do n't buy your story . try not to have any more sick relatives this week , all right ? _eos
_go i 'll do my best . _eos
_go just try to be a little more punctual in the future . _eos
_go i 'm working on it . really ! _eos
_go not much , except that my mother - in - law is driving me up the wall . _eos
_go what 's the problem ? _eos
_go she loves to nit - pick and criticizes everything that i do . i can never do anything right when she 's around . _eos
_go for example ? _eos
_go well , last week i invited her over to dinner . my husband and i had no problem with the food , but if you listened to her , then it would seem like i fed her old meat and rotten vegetables . there 's just nothing can please her . _eos
_go no , i ca n't see that happening . i know you 're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen . _eos
_go it 's not just that . she also criticizes how we raise the kids . _eos
_go my mother - in - law used to do the same thing to us . if it was n't disciplining them enough , then we were disciplining them too much . she also complained about the food we fed them , the schools we sent them too , and everything else under the sun . _eos
_go gosh , you took all the word right out of my mouth . let 's go out and get crazy tonight . _eos
_go let 's go to the new club on west street . _eos
_go sure , but what do i wear ? _eos
_go you can wear that pretty red dress . _eos
_go nothing really , why , what 's up ? _eos
_go if you are free , maybe you would like to go to a small party and having for my birthday party . it will be fun , you will get to know lots of people . _eos
_go sounds great , i 'd very much like to accept your invitation , thanks , when ? _eos
_go around six pm . _eos
_go do you need help setting up or anything ? i do n't mind . i like to do that kind of thing . it 's fun and i have a good eye for decorating . _eos
_go no . thank you . i can handle it , but thanks for the offer . _eos
_go ok , i will see you then . _eos
_go great , have a good day , thanks again for the offer . _eos
_go hello , i 'm mark . i 'm just wondering if you are free this weekend _eos
_go yes , i think so . _eos
_go good . i was thinking that i 'd like to invite you to watch a movie . i can meet you at the cinema gate . _eos
_go what 's the time ? _eos
_go six thirty , tonight . _eos
_go oh , i 'm sorry i ca n't because i have to do some housework . you can ask jenny to go with you _eos
_go all right . maybe next time i can go with you . bye ! _eos
_go good bye ! _eos
_go do n't ask such a question . you know it has no certain answer . everyone knows it is in his heart . _eos
_go then do you think that life is arranged by something above us . _eos
_go maybe , the whirligig of time , who knows ? _eos
_go right . _eos
_go really ? how did you get the chance ? _eos
_go you know . i took part in the chinese contest . i was the best and they gave me this reward . i do n't have to pay for my trip . _eos
_go congratulations . how lucky you are ! _eos
_go thank you . i 'm leaving tomorrow morning . _eos
_go i 'm sure you 'll enjoy the trip . china is such a beautiful country . _eos
_go i 'm sure i will . _eos
_go have a nice journey , lily . _eos
_go thank you , david . _eos
_go oh , i love him too . he not only sings well but also shows perseverance when he encounters difficulties in the contest . _eos
_go yeah , he got booted after his initial performance in the audition , but he did not give up . he then tried at another two auditions . _eos
_go he had barely survived the third audition and finally got a chance to advance in the contest . fortunately , in the third audition , he has won popularity among the audience . and that 's when i started to notice him . _eos
_go me too . _eos
_go before he made the top three , i was so nervous . i just fear that he might be knocked out . _eos
_go yeah , there 're so many excellent candidates out there . who knows which one will make it to the final ? _eos
_go absolutely . that 's why when he entered the final , i was so excited . _eos
_go he really did a great job in the finale , especially in the pk round . he performed so well that the majority of the audience cast their votes for him . _eos
_go and the host announced that he won it all ! _eos
_go hi , gary , what happened ? i was waiting for you at the theater . why did n't you meet me there ? _eos
_go i thought we were supposed to meet here . _eos
_go do n't you know our movie starts at seven ? and we were going to meet at the theater at five to seven . then it does n't make sense to meet at the apartment . _eos
_go i 'm sorry . we must have misunderstood each other . _eos
_go why do n't you try to be clearer about your intentions ? _eos
_go you 're right . i am sorry . let 's go and watch the movie . _eos
_go it 's okay . i do n't want to go now . we 've already missed ten minutes of the movie . i do n't want to see a movie without watching the beginning . _eos
_go it is in that brand new , tall building over there . on the 9th floor . _eos
_go where is the school cafeteria ? _eos
_go it is the basement of that red building in front of the tower with big bells . _eos
_go where is the computer center ? _eos
_go the computer center is on the first floor of the library . _eos
_go where is the library ? _eos
_go the library is next to the adminstration building . the adminstration building is over there near the school 's main entrance . there are school maps for free in the lobby of the admin . _eos
_go thank you . i will go get one . _eos
_go sure . glad to be of service . by the way , my name is mike sullivan . you will see me around a lot . i am running for president of the student government . _eos
_go well , hi ! my name is eve markowski . i am glad to meet you . with your friendly smile and helpful attitude . i am sure you will win . _eos
_go thanks you for the encouragement . _eos
_go you are welcome . i 'd better go . goodbye . _eos
_go have a good day . bye - bye ! _eos
_go no , thanks . i 've had more than enough . in fact , i must be running along . _eos
_go stay around for a while . the party is warming up . _eos
_go i 'm afraid i have to leave . i have to be up early tomorrow . _eos
_go when is it ? _eos
_go it falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month . _eos
_go could you tell me the origin of the two festivals ? _eos
_go ok . the dragon boat festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named quyuan . on that day , people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river . _eos
_go why do people eat rice cakes on that day ? _eos
_go in order to prevent the fish from eating the poet 's body . _eos
_go it sounds so moving . _eos
_go bob ! i hear your team won the match . _eos
_go yeah . all of us tried our best . _eos
_go congratulations ! _eos
_go if i want , i can protect myself by paying through an escrow account , which holds the money until i receive the item . _eos
_go that proves my point ! protect yourself or you 'll get burned . _eos
_go ebay also offers free insurance . you can get a refund of up to $ 200 if you 're not satisfied with your purchase . _eos
_go $ 200 ? if they get a hold of your credit card number , you 're going to be out a lot more than $ 200 ! i had a friend who ... _eos
_go oh , it 's nothing to speak of . _eos
_go no , seriously . i am impressed . _eos
_go thank you . i appreciate the compliment . _eos
_go hey tina . what are you doing ? _eos
_go i was just watching tv . what 's going on with you ? _eos
_go i just watched a movie and i 'm scared . _eos
_go what did you watch ? _eos
_go i saw the sixth sense . i did n't know it was going to be so scary . _eos
_go i remember that . it was a great movie . but it was definitely scary . _eos
_go if you 're not busy , do you want to come over ? i 'm afraid to be alone . _eos
_go sure . i can come over . what should we do ? _eos
_go how about if we watch a comedy . i need something to get my mind off the frightening images i have from the sixth sense . _eos
_go ok . i 'll get ready and leave . i 'll see you in about 20 minutes . _eos
_go hurry , ok . it 's dark out . _eos
_go do n't worry , nothings going to happen . i 'll be there real soon . _eos
_go ok . see you soon . _eos
_go sure i am . i 've been writing a blog for almost three years . _eos
_go oh , it seems that i 'm the only one who never blogs . when did you get started ? _eos
_go i began blogging when i first went to the us for my graduate strides . _eos
_go what do you usually write about ? _eos
_go at first , i 'll write about my life there . like interesting things on the campus , travel stories , special english words that i come across . sometimes , i 'll post my pictures on my blog so my family an _eos
_go that 's interesting . how often do you write a blog ? _eos
_go it 's random . if there happen to be a lot of things going on , i may add several new entries in a week , and if i 've got nothing to share , i may leave my blog untouched for weeks . _eos
_go got it . are you still updating your blog ? _eos
_go sure , since i came back from the us , i 've been keeping the habit of blogging , simply to share my personal insights on any topic i like . _eos
_go good for you . i know many people just leave their blogs alone after the first few months . _eos
_go no , not yet . i 'm still looking . i 've been doing some work through a temp - agency though . _eos
_go what kind of work ? _eos
_go i 'm temping at a pharmaceutic company . _eos
_go what do you do there ? _eos
_go mostly office work - filing and so on . _eos
_go how long is the assignment ? _eos
_go till the end of the month . _eos
_go en ... it tastes good . i appreciate what you have done for me . _eos
_go but we just drove across town . ca n't we just go in to see him one last ... _eos
_go i 'm afraid not . but at tomorrow 's funeral , the family requested an open casket service . _eos
_go this is all too fast . he 's my best friend , and now he 's gone . _eos
_go i 'm sorry . i know it must have come as a great shock . _eos
_go the viewing was for saying goodbye , and i did n't even get that . _eos
_go he must be green . it 's lucky that we will get off soon . _eos
_go i feel eggplants are more nutritious . _eos
_go but as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better . _eos
_go oh , that 's how you see it . _eos
_go now what are you doing ? _eos
_go putting on mascara . _eos
_go nasty . you 'd better not rub your eyes . _eos
_go i wo n't . _eos
_go and you 'd better not cry or you 'll have black streaks running down your face . _eos
_go yes , i 'm hungry . what types of food sound good ? _eos
_go maybe just a quick sandwich , salad , or something . _eos
_go i have a great idea of where you might like to go . _eos
_go can we walk there ? _eos
_go it 's on the second floor . may i join you ? _eos
_go of course ! let 's go . _eos
_go let 's hurry . i 'm starving ! _eos
_go i want to go traveling . _eos
_go do you have any where in mind ? _eos
_go yes , i 've been thinking about florida . _eos
_go sorry , i just worried about him . you know , he should be here an hour ago . _eos
_go do n't worry him , he has been grown up and i think he can take himself very well . _eos
_go but he still does not come back . _eos
_go maybe he is on the way home now . _eos
_go for almost two years . _eos
_go almost two years ? your english is very good . _eos
_go thank you . but there 's still a lot for me to learn . _eos
_go johnson ? i ca n't place them . _eos
_go we met them in bermuda last may . _eos
_go they 've completely slipped my mind . _eos
_go the couple with the dogs , think back . _eos
_go no , i do n't recall a thing about them . _eos
_go well , i 've invited them for brunch . _eos
_go hmm , i must be getting absent - minded . _eos
_go what a miser ! he cycles to school every day . _eos
_go his grandfather 's money is not his . _eos
_go i ca n't understand him anyway . _eos
_go he said he would tell us the secret of becoming a successful man . _eos
_go it 's too good to be true ! if i were there , i would ask him if he himself was a successful man . _eos
_go nobody would drive him up a wall by asking him such a question , you know . _eos
_go hey , isabelle ... _eos
_go logan ! why on earth are you hiding here ? white hat ! come on ! do n't tell me you 're the guy ! it ca n't be true . _eos
_go yes , i am the guy ... _eos
_go what a bummer ! you set me up ? _eos
_go let me explain . i did n't mean to hurt you ... _eos
_go well , i 'd like to , but i am not sure i have time . _eos
_go oh , come on ! just a quick one ! _eos
_go all right , just a quick one . _eos
_go certainly . jackie chan is a very famous movie star in hong kong . his chinese name is cheng long . _eos
_go ha , i know cheng long a lot , he has made 40 films since 1976 . and at that time he was promoted as the new bruce lee . but i 'm not familiar with his english name . _eos
_go ok . then tell me what else you know . _eos
_go some movie stars measure their worth by how many millions of dollars they make . do you know how jackie chan measures his worth ? _eos
_go he measures his worth by how many of his bones he has fractured while executing his film , incredible stunts . by the way , can you count the breaks ? _eos
_go sure . his skull , his eyes , his nose , three times , his jaw , his shoul - der , is chest , two fingers , a knee . as he said'everything from the top of my head to the bottom of my feet ! ' _eos
_go indeed you know much about him . _eos
_go this is because he is the action - movie incarnate or action - star extraordinaire around the world . _eos
_go oh , that 's all right . _eos
_go i must apologize . i 'll buy you a new one tomorrow . _eos
_go no , please do n't . i could n't let you do that . _eos
_go yes , what 's it ? _eos
_go what does mph stand for ? _eos
_go it 's miles per hour . _eos
_go wait ! look at that board , what 's on it ? _eos
_go ' please do n't enter the bamboo groves .'we're not allowed to go in . _eos
_go then we 'd better not go . _eos
_go ok . _eos
_go not yet . i 'm not finished with my research yet . _eos
_go what research ? _eos
_go reading my fashion magazines ! how do you think i know so much about all the latest trends ? _eos
_go but they 're just ads . _eos
_go duh ... that 's the point . the people in the ads are wearing what 's in . plus , there are articles on new trends . _eos
_go i think there 's a western on . _eos
_go do you mind if we watch it . i 'd really like to see it . _eos
_go well , i really wanted to see the football game . _eos
_go football game ? ok , and you know what comes on next ? _eos
_go i believe there 's a sitcom . _eos
_go are you interested in watching it ? _eos
_go let me look in the tv guide first . _eos
_go oh , i am sorry . what 's on channel 2 at 10 pm ? _eos
_go if i remember correctly , it 's a quiz show . _eos
_go do you want to watch it ? _eos
_go let 's watch it together . _eos
_go it was funny . _eos
_go tell me about it , will you ? _eos
_go well , we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning . it was a magnificent sight . _eos
_go did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures ? _eos
_go sure , we would n't miss it for anything . after that , we took a short cut to the park . there was very little traffic , so we got there in less than an hour . _eos
_go you were lucky then . what did you do after that ? _eos
_go we went for a swim in the sea . that was the best part of the day . just look at my nice tan . _eos
_go so you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday . _eos
_go yes , you 're right . and i was so tired that i fell asleep on the way back . my arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday . _eos
_go how do you know that ? _eos
_go she told me that peter and she has a quarrel last nigh , and she left this morning , bag and baggage . _eos
_go oh , i see . but i think you are making a fuss . they will make it up . bet it . _eos
_go what do i do with it ? _eos
_go do you want me to help you ? _eos
_go please . _eos
_go look . here are the core classes . everyone has to take them . _eos
_go so i do n't have to worry about them . _eos
_go you 're catching on ! however , there are elective courses like wood shop , metal shop , home economics ... _eos
_go i 'll take home economics . _eos
_go good . now you can pick classes by yourself . _eos
_go but i ... i do n't agree with thatbecause computers weaken kids'ability to thinkbecause kids do n't learn basic skills . _eos
_go what do you mean ? _eos
_go they ca n't spell , they ca n't add , they ca n't subtract , they even do n't remember any more . that 's because they rely on gadgets . _eos
_go that 's not the gadgets . creating programmes is stimulate thoughts . it engages their imagination and sharpen their mind . _eos
_go yeah , what 's up ? _eos
_go next monday is my birthday , and i would like you to attend my party . _eos
_go wow . i 'd love to . _eos
_go great ! _eos
_go when and where ? _eos
_go five o'clock that afternoon , and in my place , you know ? _eos
_go yes , i know . i appreciate your invitation . _eos
_go i am going to invite other guys . see you that day . _eos
_go see you . _eos
_go i 'm pretty tired these days . _eos
_go why ? you 're not working so do n't you have a lot of time on your hands ? _eos
_go i have so much house work to do . i have to take care of the kids , cook , clean , laundry , and the cycle never ends . _eos
_go how about your husband . does he help much ? _eos
_go not at all . he comes home and complains about his hard day at work . he expects me to do everything . he even wants me to feed him sometimes . can you believe that ? _eos
_go that sucks . _eos
_go if he was n't so lazy , i think i would n't have any complaints . he mows the lawn , but can you believe he tried to convince me to do it ? _eos
_go that 's crossing the line . _eos
_go oh well . i 'll have to live with it . what else can i do ? _eos
_go of course . it 's the tradition game in winter , and with good reason . do n't you like watching it ? _eos
_go of course i do . i love it . all the games are exciting and the competitors are respectable . _eos
_go that 's true . for various reasons , it takes more to hold a fierce game for winter olympics than it does for summer olympics . you know , the low temperature may cause many problems . _eos
_go yeah . what 's the difference between the winter olympics and the summer olympics ? _eos
_go when the olympic games started in modern times , only summer events were included . when it grew popular , there came the winter olympic games , which includes a variety of winter sports . _eos
_go i see . then , what 's your favorite winter sport ? _eos
_go figure skating . in my eye , nothing beats it . _eos
_go then you must know shen due and hao hongbo . _eos
_go oh , i did n't expect you to know them . but yes , i love them not only because of many medals they 've won , but also because of many medals they 've won , but also because of their spirits . _eos
_go you should go to talk with may . she is a big fan of them too . _eos
_go i want to travel . _eos
_go where would you like to go ? _eos
_go the seaside . _eos
_go that 's really a good idea . taking a walk on the beach and lying in the sun are pretty good . i recommend you qingdao or dalian . _eos
_go i 've been to qingdao before , so i 'll choose dalian . i 've heard that the environment there is very good . _eos
_go yes , that 's a good place to spend a holiday . last year i went there . it 's really . _eos
_go thank you ! _eos
_go no , thank you , mrs . carter . i 'm fine for now . _eos
_go just make yourself at home . the other guests should be arriving shortly . _eos
_go thank you very much for your kindness . _eos
_go is there any clue ? _eos
_go no , he left nothing . _eos
_go oh , i 'll go to shanghai to practice there . _eos
_go that 's a good idea . it must be easy to find a job in shanghai . _eos
_go i think so , you know there is a great deal of opportunity for business there . _eos
_go and english is very useful in your job . _eos
_go i think it will be very useful in many ways . beside , shanghai is an important trade center , not only in china , but also in the world , english is useful in almost all walks of life . _eos
_go you will be a very promising one . _eos
_go that 's my wish . _eos
_go yes , my parents , and soon my brother as well . _eos
_go i did n't know you had a brother . _eos
_go oh , yes , he is two years older than me . he lives in new zealand so i do n't see him that often . _eos
_go oh , nice . is he coming on his own or with the family ? _eos
_go his son is coming as well . he wants to go to university here in england so they will visit a few universities while they are here . _eos
_go does your brother have just one son ? _eos
_go no , he has two daughters as well . his wife and daughters are visiting her parents . so i wo n't see them . _eos
_go i 'm sure your parents are looking forward to seeing their grandson . _eos
_go oh yes , they are really looking forward to it . they went to new zealand last year and loved it . _eos
_go so when are they all coming ? _eos
_go my parents are already here . my brother and nephew are arriving on monday . _eos
_go i am swapped with work after 10 - day holiday . _eos
_go where did you spend your holiday ? _eos
_go i went to paris . _eos
_go i 'm from canada , originally . _eos
_go from canada ? where were you born ? _eos
_go montreal . _eos
_go when did you come to los angeles ? _eos
_go we moved here when i was fourteen . _eos
_go did you go to school here ? _eos
_go well , i went to high school here , but i went to college in texas . _eos
_go did you get a job right after graduation ? _eos
_go no , i traveled for a while in europe after college , and then i lived in france . _eos
_go when was that ? _eos
_go let 's see ... that was about six years ago . _eos
_go i bet that was interesting . what did you do there ? _eos
_go i studied french . anyway ... that 's enough about me . how about you ? were you born in l . a . ? _eos
_go yes , i 'm a very good mother and successful career woman . _eos
_go how can you manage to do both ? i mean , it is so hard to be a working mother . _eos
_go i think the most important thing is that you should be nice to yourself , like keeping housework simple , spending money on things that make life easier , buying yourself things you like , and so on . you can only be nice to others when you can be nice to yourself . _eos
_go does your husband feel the same ? _eos
_go yes . he is very understanding and supportive . _eos
_go let me give you a little advice . you know what the topics are going to be , so prepares what you would like to say in advance . _eos
_go i often do , but i 'm worried about the responses from other people . _eos
_go you have to be realistic . not everyone is going to agree with you , but people will respect your opinion and they will respect the fact that you have contributed something to the discussion . _eos
_go i 'm worried that what i say will not make sense . _eos
_go we could chat about the topic before class . i could check that what you want to say is logical and it would also give you a chance to practice speaking . _eos
_go that 's a good idea . what should i do if i am in two minds about a topic ? _eos
_go that 's easy . express possibilities . people will think that you are pretty smart to be able to look at the topic from more than one angle . _eos
_go i did n't realize that speaking in class could be so easy . _eos
_go the most difficult thing is being able to predict what other people will say . they will reply to your statements , but you ca n't be sure how . _eos
_go he used to be a policeman . _eos
_go but mrs . smith hired him to find her lost son . _eos
_go yeah . he 's a private eye now . _eos
_go where do they come from ? _eos
_go i do n't know . something rotten here ? _eos
_go i ca n't see it . _eos
_go my invitation ? no , i have n't . my invitation to what ? _eos
_go the house warming party . _eos
_go whose house warming party is it ? _eos
_go tom and bill smith . they are both working now you know ? and they 've bought a new house . _eos
_go oh , they have ? i did n't know . i have n't seen tom lately . _eos
_go it 's out in the suburbs . _eos
_go have you seen the house ? _eos
_go yes , i have . i went out with them last weekend . _eos
_go is it nice ? _eos
_go yes , it is . there are three bedrooms , a living room , a dining room , and a big kitchen . _eos
_go there 's also a garden . _eos
_go well , that does sound nice . have they moved in yet ? _eos
_go they are moving today . tom 's taken the day off . he 's rented a truck , and they should have all their furniture in the house tonight . _eos
_go when are they going to have the party ? _eos
_go next saturday night . you should get your invitation today or tomorrow . _eos
_go wow , that would be something to look forward to . _eos
_go i could go for that . but i 'm afraid our budget is a little tight this year . _eos
_go oh , but i really need to leave this town for a change . working day after day has worn me out . do you have any other suggestions ? _eos
_go we should probably think about going somewhere that is n't too far away . how about the countryside ? there must be many interesting places , and we could enjoy the fresh air and the delicious local spec _eos
_go wonderful ! i think that 's a great idea . how soon until we can make this happen ? i ca n't wait ! _eos
_go tomorrow i have an appointment with my dentist . what about next monday ? _eos
_go perfect . i 'll start preparing tomorrow . if we 're going to drive , i 'll need to fill up the tank . _eos
_go no need . i think it 's still plenty full . even so , i 'd rather travel by bus or train . it would cost much less than driving . oil prices are soaring nowadays , you know . _eos
_go we can take the train , that will be faster . i 'll book the tickets tomorrow morning . _eos
_go great ! oh , one more thing , do n't forget to check the weather before we go . i 'd hate to get caught in the rain . _eos
_go no problem . i 'm really looking forward to the coming week . _eos
_go me , too . now let 's make a list for what we need to take with us . _eos
_go sounds good . where are we going ? _eos
_go somewhere new . it 's a great place to pick up chicks . _eos
_go need a new . girlfriend , huh ? _eos
_go yeah , i broke up with lisa . she blew a gasket over it . whoa , get a load of that ! _eos
_go whew ! that getup is terrific ! _eos
_go never mind the getup . she 's beautiful ! _eos
_go that too . _eos
_go i 'm gon na introduce myself . _eos
_go if you 're lucky , that might do the trick . _eos
_go oh , oh , that tears it ! i 'm getting out of here . _eos
_go hold on ! what 's the big hurry ? _eos
_go my ex - girlfriend 's here . if she sees me , my goose is cooked . _eos
_go i wanna finish my drink first . i 'll meet you at sammy 's . _eos
_go ok , catch you later . _eos
_go darlene ! indeed , it 's been a while ! how have you been ? wow , you look amazing ! i love what you 've done with your hair ! _eos
_go really ? thanks ! i went to that hair salon that you told me about , but enough about me ! look at you ! you have n't aged a day since the last time i saw you ! what is your secret ! _eos
_go ha ha , come on ! well , i 've been watching what i eat , and working out three times a week . by the way , i heard your son recently graduated ! _eos
_go yes , my little paul is finally a doctor . they grow up so fast you know . _eos
_go he is such a handsome guy . he gets his looks from his mother of course ! _eos
_go thank you ! what about your daughter , pamela ? i heard she has passed the bar exam and married recently . _eos
_go oh yes . she had a beautiful wedding in cozumel mexico and we all attended . _eos
_go such a lovely girl . i hope my paul is lucky enough to find a girl like that someday ! _eos
_go but of course ! well , it 's been great talking to you , but i have to get going . _eos
_go same here ! we will catch up soon , maybe over coffee ! _eos
_go that would be great ! give me a call ! _eos
_go see you soon ! bye ! egg ... i ca n't stand that woman or her obnoxious daughter . _eos
_go yeah . it was hard . when do you take it ? _eos
_go i take it tomorrow morning . there is so much material that i do nt know what to emphasize on . what types of questions did you get ? _eos
_go mostly on the civil war . you should also study the impact martin luther king jr . had on american society . _eos
_go what about abraham lincoln ? did you get any questions about him ? _eos
_go i only had 1 question about him . but you might get more . i do nt know if he will have the same exam or not . _eos
_go hopefully he will use the same exam , cause i m going to spend most of my time studying the civil war . it is a huge section and that is what he lectured the most on in class . _eos
_go if you ca nt study everything , then that is probably the best way to go . _eos
_go aright . thanks for the info . i got ta go to the library now . _eos
_go good luck . _eos
_go thanks . see ya . _eos
_go it 's us . _eos
_go what do you mean by " us " ? _eos
_go well , we used to talk to each other before we were married . remember ? _eos
_go what do you mean ? we 're talking now , are n't we ? _eos
_go oh , yes , but we used to do so much together . _eos
_go yes . i remember . but we never used to argue . you used to think i was wonderful . where are you going ? _eos
_go back to live with my parents . that 's something else i used to do before we were married . remember ? _eos
_go yes . do you like it ? _eos
_go it 's great . and i 've heard that listening to mozart can make you more intelligent . _eos
_go really ? i 've never heard that before . i just like it . _eos
_go is classical music your favorite ? _eos
_go yes . what about you ? _eos
_go i like pop music best . classical music is a bit too heavy for me . i ca n't get fully relaxed in it . _eos
_go pop music does n't have any depth for me . _eos
_go yeah , that 's why i can enjoy myself in it . _eos
_go did you always like pop music . _eos
_go i think so , since i was in primary school . how long have you been interested in classical music . _eos
_go i did n't like it at all until i started to learn violin when i was eight . from then on . classical music has been an important part of my life . _eos
_go oh , i did n't know you can play the violin . do you still play . _eos
_go sometimes , but these days i 'm often too busy . _eos
_go most people were living form hand to mouth . how could they ? _eos
_go yeah . they simply had no extra money to save up or for other things . _eos
_go fortunately , things are changing these years . _eos
_go a friend and i are planing to go out , why ? what 's up ? _eos
_go there is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum , i was hoping you 'd like to come with me . _eos
_go i am afraid i ca n't i am going to be out all day . _eos
_go what about sunday ? _eos
_go i wish i could , but it 's my mums birthday . _eos
_go maybe next week . _eos
_go much as i 'd like to , i am afraid i wo nt be free next week , i have a lot of work . _eos
_go sorry to hear that , i was really looking forward to spending some more time with you , i really enjoyed our last chat . _eos
_go i am really sorry too , maybe i can give you a call sometime . _eos
_go yeah , i 'm going for a hike in the southern rocky mountains . _eos
_go oh , do you go hiking often ? _eos
_go i go as much as i can . i love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature . _eos
_go it would be nice to get out of the city . do you want some company ? _eos
_go sure . but , it will be a long hike , 30 miles in three days . have you been hiking before ? _eos
_go yeah , i go a lot too . i saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike . _eos
_go wow ! you must have been pretty far away from the city . _eos
_go yeah , my friend and i hiked in a very wild part of the national forest . _eos
_go well , bring him along too . we 'll have a great time this weekend . _eos
_go thanks , i 'll ask him . _eos
_go i do n't know if anything terrible has happened . _eos
_go i have reported it to the police . _eos
_go we 'd better prepare for the worst . _eos
_go he won the decathlon in the 1976 olympics , right ? _eos
_go i read that he trained so much that he used to dream about jumping hurdles . _eos
_go i can think of better things to dream about ... _eos
_go sometimes he would wake up covered in sweat , with his legs pumping away . _eos
_go that 's crazy . _eos
_go what 's wrong with it ? _eos
_go what 's wrong with it ? it 's filthy ! _eos
_go oh ... _eos
_go it 's filthy because you never wipe your shoes . _eos
_go sorry , love . _eos
_go what are you looking for now ? _eos
_go my cigarettes . _eos
_go well , they 're not here . they are in the dustbin . _eos
_go in the dustbin ! why did n't you tell me before ? _eos
_go yes , i do . but my characters are very bad . _eos
_go it takes a long time to learn chinese writing . _eos
_go are you chinese by birth ? _eos
_go yes , i am . i am from guangzhou . i am here to study international relations . _eos
_go how do you like it ? _eos
_go i like it so far . but my english still needs work . _eos
_go i want to study mandarin and public relations . _eos
_go sure . it 's probably a skiing show . adam told me there are many skiing clubs whose members put on shows to attract more visitors . _eos
_go look at that . it 's so dangerous . my mom would never allow me to do that . _eos
_go stop all this fuss and enjoy the show . _eos
_go you are right . but what if an avalanche happened ? _eos
_go they are all great skiers and very experienced . so i suppose the chance for them to be buried by an avalanche is slim . _eos
_go anyway , the show is breathtaking . by the way , where did they get so much snow here ? _eos
_go well , they have the most advanced snowmaking machine . _eos
_go do you think the snowmaking may cause pollution ? _eos
_go it 's possible . _eos
_go two , i hope and i hope that by telling me about them you are planning on taking me ! _eos
_go of course ! and here 's the best part , they are court side seats ! _eos
_go how in the world ! who came up with seats like that from your company ? _eos
_go some guy in the accounting department has a brother on the team ! _eos
_go ca n't beat that ! thank you accounting guy ! _eos
_go the game starts at seven so we 'd better hustle , it 's already five . _eos
_go what are we waiting for ? let 's go ! _eos
_go ok ! how about scrabble ? _eos
_go no , no , a friend of mine taught me this really fun game . i 'm going to describe someone 's face , and you guess who it is ! _eos
_go ok ! _eos
_go let 's see . he has a roman nose , bushy eyebrows and dimples ! _eos
_go our cousin pete ! my turn ! she has a pointy nose , sunken eyes and a mole on her chin ! _eos
_go aunt rose ! that mole is so huge ! ok , my turn . he has a crooked nose and full lips . he has quite a few freckles and an oval face . oh , he is also bald ! _eos
_go your future husband ! _eos
_go not funny . _eos
_go it bears a great many of advantages , but also some weak points . _eos
_go is it ? i 've never thought of any disadvantages of the mobile phone . _eos
_go for instance , the mobile phone seriously distracts the attention of people from work and study . _eos
_go that 's true . some people pay too much attention to their mobile phones . _eos
_go actually , it 's not the fault of the mobile phone . but people should have a proper attitude towards it . mobile phone is a tool serving people , not the fetters restricting them . _eos
_go good news ! and congratulations ! _eos
_go you are invited to my wedding . _eos
_go thank you . i 'll certainly be there . _eos
_go sure . but it 's a very difficult one , you need to have a dictionary at your elbow . _eos
_go but i 'm not used to looking up every new word when i 'm reading a novel . i only look up the most necessary ones . _eos
_go i 'm afraid many people would turn thumbs down on it . _eos
_go do n't you think in that case , there would n't be so much stealing ? _eos
_go definitely . but i think it is too fierce . _eos
_go sure , but let 's get a pitcher this time we should be able to down it before they close . _eos
_go that sounds good . you order the beer while i go to the bathroom . where is the can in this place ? _eos
_go it 's all the way to the back . see that yellow door ? _eos
_go yeah . i think i can find it . _eos
_go you 're back already . that sure was quick . _eos
_go that 's because i just took one step inside and turned right around . that bathroom is too gross for me . _eos
_go well , the bartender would n't give me the pitcher of beer . anyway . he said it was too close to closing time . _eos
_go let 's leave then . i could take some fresh air , anyway . _eos
_go okay , let 's go ! _eos
_go well , i spend a lot of time watching movies . _eos
_go what a confidence ! i always watch a lot of movies , too . _eos
_go oh really , frank ? what kind of movies do you like ? _eos
_go actually , i watch whichever movie there is , be it a comedy , a sci - fi or a suspense movie . how about you ? _eos
_go art films are my favorite , but thrillers are cool , too . _eos
_go really impressive . these two genres are totally different . _eos
_go sure . i enjoy both of them very much . _eos
_go how often do you go to the cinema ? _eos
_go once in a while , i suppose , i usually rent movies at movie salon . _eos
_go movie salon ? where is that ? _eos
_go it 's a movie rental store in my neighborhood . i 've got a membership there . _eos
_go is it good ? _eos
_go yes , you can find almost all new releases there . _eos
_go really ? maybe i shall also sign up for its membership . _eos
_go why not ? _eos
_go really ? that 's so great . congratulations . _eos
_go thanks . i 'm so excited . we 've been trying for 8 months now . _eos
_go that 's really exciting . how many months are you pregnant ? _eos
_go three months . _eos
_go are you going to find out if it is a boy or a girl ? _eos
_go i want to , but bob does n't . he wants to be surprised like the old fashioned way . _eos
_go maybe it 's more exciting not knowing . _eos
_go i 'd rather know and buy all the baby things ahead of time . _eos
_go there are so many things you have to prepare for . _eos
_go i know i am going to be busy , but i know i can handle it . i have been looking forward to this day for a long long time . _eos
_go it really must be an exciting time for you guys . _eos
_go thank you so much . _eos
_go she did n't expect to get a kick in the teeth after a day 's hard work . _eos
_go poor girl ! _eos
_go unbelievable ! how do people go through it ? _eos
_go that 's what i 'm wondering , too . _eos
_go i wish i had a chance to see it with my own eyes . _eos
_go much to my regret , i 'll have to meet my girlfriend at the airport then . _eos
_go we 'd like to invite you for our dress party tomorrow evening , are you free ? _eos
_go much as we 'd like to , but we 've booked up already for that time . _eos
_go what a pity ! you ca n't join us . _eos
_go so sorry . next time we 'll go , thanks anyway . _eos
_go thank you for your inition . i 'm free tonight . _eos
_go which kind of food do you like , chinese food , western food or sea food ? _eos
_go i prefer sea food . _eos
_go ok . i 'll pick up your hotel at 6 thirty pm . _eos
_go that 's fine . i 'll be waiting for you . _eos
_go see you later . _eos
_go bye . _eos
_go if that happen to me , i 'll take them back to the shop . _eos
_go i did . but they said they wo n't change them . _eos
_go that 's terrible . but if they would n't change them , i know what i would do . _eos
_go of course ! it is the no . 1 stressor in my life . you know job stress has become a very common problem these days . so we must learn to cope with it . _eos
_go totally agree . what is your solution ? _eos
_go well , there are two causes of job stress . one is employee characteristic and the other is company condition . so if we want to manage job stress , both we and the companies should do something . for me , i am trying to balance work and leisure time . you know , all work and no play make jack a dull boy . _eos
_go you seem to have a very relaxed outlook . _eos
_go it is necessary . positive attitude helps to prevent stress . _eos
_go but i do n't think we can change our working condition . anyway , we are not the bosses . _eos
_go i heard some companies are providing stress management training and making changes inside them , like avoiding unrealistic deadlines and organizing relaxation activities . our boss is a smart person . he will be learning from that if he would like to an efficient and healthy team . _eos
_go can i help you ? _eos
_go i 'm not sure . perhaps you could do the shopping . _eos
_go i 'll be glad to help . _eos
_go or maybe make the beds . _eos
_go all you have to do is ask for help . _eos
_go thanks . that 's terrific ! _eos
_go i 'm ready and willing to help . _eos
_go good . i love chinese food . what did you order ? _eos
_go something hot and spicy . they look very inviting on the menu . you are going to love them . _eos
_go maybe we can find a place to learn some chinese cooking . i hear there 's a place in chinatown where you can take some courses . are you interested ? _eos
_go i 'm not sure . i do n't enjoy cooking that much . as long as we can order it from a restaurant , we do n't have to learn to do it by ourselves . _eos
_go you are right . but i just want to know how they prepare food and make it taste so different . _eos
_go i could n't do that . i have an important meeting to go to today . _eos
_go do you feel ok ? _eos
_go not really . after a 12 - hour flight , i 've got jetlag , and on top of that , i think i 've also got the flu . _eos
_go why do n't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting ? you should really get some rest or you 'll end up feeling even worse than you do now . _eos
_go could you feel my forehead and check to see if i have a fever ? _eos
_go you 're really hot . let me get you some tylenol to bring the fever down . _eos
_go ok . i 'll stay home this morning and rest , but if i feel better in the afternoon , i 'm going to the meeting . _eos
_go zach , what 's that on your arm ? _eos
_go i do n't know . it looks a bit red , but i 'm sure it 's nothing . _eos
_go it looks like you have a red rash all over you ! are you allergic to anything ? _eos
_go just cats , but i do n't think i was near any cats in the last couple of weeks . _eos
_go i completely forgot about your cat allergy . i took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago . oh no . we 'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine . let 's go . _eos
_go should n't we make an appointment first ? _eos
_go we would , but let 's just go and see if there 's an opening now before it gets worse . _eos
_go whatever you say . i just want to get to my meeting ! _eos
_go that 's too bad . _eos
_go yes , most of the time . but , sometimes things can get difficult . _eos
_go can you tell me about it ? _eos
_go you know , sometimes patients can get very unreasonable . they may insist they are sick when they are not . _eos
_go what can you do when this happens ? _eos
_go not much , usually i 'll just keep silent . _eos
_go not yet . _eos
_go we 'd better go out for a walk . _eos
_go which season do you like best ? _eos
_go spring . _eos
_go how about summer ? _eos
_go i dislike it most . _eos
_go why ? _eos
_go because the hottest season is summer in a year . _eos
_go but sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons . _eos
_go it was a real red letter day for you . _eos
_go yeah . we rolled out the red carpet to welcome him home . _eos
_go cool , fellow , what 's the date today , buddy ? _eos
_go it 's ... oh it 's the 1st april , april fool 's day . _eos
_go you forgot all of about it , did n't you ? _eos
_go okay . keep in touch . _eos
_go i 'm sorry , we have no mid - size available at the moment . _eos
_go i do n't understand , i made a reservation , do you have my reservation ? _eos
_go yes , we do , unfortunately we ran out of cars . _eos
_go but the reservation keeps the car here . that 's why you have the reservation . _eos
_go i know why we have reservations . _eos
_go i do n't think you do . if you did , i 'd have a car . see , you know how to take the reservation , you just do n't know how to hold the reservation and that 's really the most important part of the reservation , the holding . anybody can just take them . _eos
_go but we do have a compact or an suv if you 'd like . _eos
_go fine . i 'll take the compact . _eos
_go alright . we have a blue ford focus for you , mr . fox . would you like insurance ? _eos
_go yeah , you better give me the insurance , because i am gon na beat the hell out of this car . _eos
_go no , i think harry will get it . _eos
_go let 's make a bet on who gets it . _eos
_go ok , loser buys pizza tomorrow night . _eos
_go well , i was wondering where those people with professional attire come from . now , i know the answer . _eos
_go you know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in july , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , is n't that strict ? _eos
_go to some extent , it is . anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression . _eos
_go but it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . if they 're not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive . _eos
_go did n't you hear ? he was disqualified . _eos
_go how did that happen ? he 's so talented ! i thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal ! _eos
_go if he did n't have any drug problems , he would have won . _eos
_go what ? what kind of drugs was he using ? _eos
_go he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster . _eos
_go i thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs . _eos
_go they are . the only reason they did n't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards . _eos
_go that 's so disappointing . i do n't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs . _eos
_go i do n't think it 's right , but i can understand why they might . imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country ! _eos
_go regardless of how much pressure you 're under , there 's never a good reason to take drugs . _eos
_go i agree . hopefully with the new regulations , fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs . _eos
_go let 's hope so . _eos
_go that 's because americans love sitcoms . _eos
_go sitcoms ? _eos
_go situation comedies . a sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . if there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values . _eos
_go in taiwan , prime - time shows are an hour long and most of them are n't comedies . _eos
_go i think americans would rather laugh than cry or be scared in their free time . _eos
_go yes , i am . i enjoyed studying it at school , though i had trouble remembering all the dates , so my teacher never gave me good marks . _eos
_go i love history , but i 've always thought that learning the reasons behind events is more important than remembering exactly when they happened . _eos
_go i wish you had been my history teacher ! i might have got better marks ! _eos
_go some people say that history repeats itself . _eos
_go what does that mean ? the same events never happen twice , do they ? _eos
_go the idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same . _eos
_go i see . i think i 'd agree with that statement . people often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again . _eos
_go you , too . _eos
_go you see , i 've been offered a new job . i ca n't decide whether to take it or not . _eos
_go oh , that 's easy . if it 's better than the one you are doing now , go for it . that 's my advice . _eos
_go it is n't that easy . i hate to quit my present job . people around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging . _eos
_go then what about the salary ? would you get more ? _eos
_go yes , they say i would get a big sum . _eos
_go have you discussed it with your wife ? _eos
_go yes , she leaves it to me . _eos
_go as i say it the work is well worth try . after all you can get a higher salary . _eos
_go i have to think about it . _eos
_go both actually . s , y , b , i , l . _eos
_go of course . _eos
_go that 's great . he 's the best runner i 've seen this season . i 'm sure he 'll win a medal at the olympics . _eos
_go i think you 're right . i think we have a very good athletics team . they should do well in the olympics . how many medals do you think we 'll win ? _eos
_go i really do n't know . i do n't think we 'll win many gold medals , but i think we should win several silver and bronze ones . _eos
_go what do you think our chance are in other events . _eos
_go in the last olympics , we did very well in swimming , cycling and ball sports . i think we 'll do well in those same events . _eos
_go we might get a gold medal in the sailing too . our team put in a lot of practice . _eos
_go i think we can expect to get between 30 to 40 medals in total . _eos
_go you are very optimistic ! _eos
_go i may have something on that day , but thanks for inviting me . _eos
_go well , drop by if you can . _eos
_go i will , do you want me to bring anything ? _eos
_go no , just bring yourself . i hope to see you there . _eos
_go really ? but his wife has always waited on him hand and foot . _eos
_go i hear that john 's leading a double wife . _eos
_go it 's very bad of him to cheat on a lady like his wife . _eos
_go i have n't played chess for a long time . _eos
_go that 's all right , i 'm a beginner . i 've just learnt how to play . _eos
_go look , there 's a chessboard . those two men have already finished playing . _eos
_go you 're a very good player _eos
_go not really , but once i won a prize . _eos
_go so did i . i won a prize last week but it was a prize for beginners . _eos
_go my prize was for the best player in the country . now let 's start playing chess seriously . _eos
_go yeah , about . _eos
_go do you know chinese better now ? _eos
_go oh , definitely . i remember , when i first arrived in guangzhou , my girlfriend was haggling with a sales clerk over the price of a mobile phone . _eos
_go oh , yeah . many chinese like to bargain . it happens almost everywhere . _eos
_go i mean , i understand that . but the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . my perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . the truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation . _eos
_go a shouting match ? you 're so funny . you must be exaggerating . i do n't believe it . _eos
_go i am not exaggerating at all . i 'm telling you the truth . that was how i felt at that time . _eos
_go yes , perhaps . chinese usually do n't notice that sort of thing . maybe it 's quite natural to us . _eos
_go yes , absolutely true . _eos
_go harry potter . _eos
_go harry potter ? is that book funny ? _eos
_go actually , the language itself is not so funny , but you can imagine the scene , that 's funny . _eos
_go got it . _eos
_go have you ever read this book before ? _eos
_go no , but my little brother likes it very much . _eos
_go it 's really a good book . you will like it too . _eos
_go i 'll try to read it . actually , i like literature very much . _eos
_go wow , that sounds like a scholar . by the way , who 's your favorite writer ? _eos
_go jane austen . _eos
_go me too . pride and prejudice is my favorite . _eos
_go i like it too . but sense and sensibility is my favorite . _eos
_go thanks , tim . nice meeting you , too . _eos
_go i guess we 'll see just around . _eos
_go ye , i hope so . well . take it easy . _eos
_go you too . _eos
_go i 've had it with tim ! i think i 'm going to quit ! _eos
_go but sandra ... you love your job ! you spent months trying to get this position . it 's perfect for you ! _eos
_go yeah ... i know . but i 'm sick and tired of all the office power struggles ! _eos
_go what kind of power struggles are you talking about ? _eos
_go basically , i think tim is threatened by me . i 'm doing a better job than he is so he 's trying to sabotage my career ! _eos
_go so he talks about you behind your back ? _eos
_go yes . he 's all nice and friendly to my face . but the second i turn around he stabs me in the back ! _eos
_go i had a worker like that once . she was always taking credit for my ideas . _eos
_go i should keep a better record of my correspondence with the clients so if necessary i can prove it was my effort . _eos
_go my co - worker had a whole bunch of bad office habits . she liked to name - drop ... we would be in a meeting and she would say , yesterday i was chatting with tom . she meant tom solomon ... our ceo . _eos
_go what is it ? what happened ? _eos
_go i think someone is stalking me . _eos
_go no , it ca n't be . really ? who ? _eos
_go i do n't know . i saw him the first time tuesday . he was at the cafe . i noticed he was looking at me a lot . not just the usual looking , but staring . he just kept staring at me . he did n't stop . _eos
_go what did you do ? _eos
_go i did n't do anything . finally , he left . but then i saw him again today . outside the shoe store . near the cafe . i went into a cd store and pretended i was looking at cd 's . but then he came in too . _eos
_go did he leave when you left ? _eos
_go yes . then i noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me . he was following me . _eos
_go what did you do ? _eos
_go yes , i know a great place . what types of food do you like ? _eos
_go mexican , japanese or chinese would be great . _eos
_go oh , i know a place where you might like to eat . _eos
_go is it close by ? _eos
_go it 's down a block on the right ; can i show you the way ? _eos
_go ok , i 'd love the company . _eos
_go this will work out well . i 'm getting hungry just thinking about it . _eos
_go when i was young , my parents took me to the one in california . i always forget which -- is that one disneyland or disneyworld ? _eos
_go the one in florida is disneyworld and the one in california is disneyland , so you must have been to disneyland . _eos
_go that 's right . why do you ask ? _eos
_go well , i 've never been to either so i was thinking of going to disneyworld for my honeymoon . _eos
_go when are you getting married ? _eos
_go some time next year . we have n't set the date yet . _eos
_go congratulations ! i had no idea . _eos
_go thank you . so what do you think ? would we have a good time ? _eos
_go do you like amusement parks ? _eos
_go for the most part , yes . some of the rides are bit too scary for me , though . _eos
_go if you do n't think twice about the rides and go on every ride that you can , you 'll have a good time . _eos
_go even the roller coasters that go through tunnels in the dark ? _eos
_go even those . it 'll be very romantic , i think . you 'll have loads of fun . _eos
_go thanks for the advice . i 'll talk to my fiance about it tonight . _eos
_go i 'm sure he 'll love the idea . just throw yourself into it and you 'll enjoy it ! _eos
_go steve ! have n't seen you in ages ! how long 's it been ? _eos
_go it 's got to be almost a year now . _eos
_go how have you been ? _eos
_go i 'm pretty good . i 've been looking for a place to live recently . my lease runs out next month and i do n't want to renew it . _eos
_go yeah , i remember the neighborhood . have you found a place yet ? _eos
_go not yet . but i am still looking through the classifieds . wish me luck . _eos
_go well , maybe i can help . remember my neighbor ? _eos
_go mrs . thou ? _eos
_go yes , her daughter 's having a baby , so she 's moving in with her to help out . i think if you are interested , you can come over and have a look . _eos
_go great . it 's a lovely neighborhood . and it would be nice to be neighbors again . it would be just like the old days ! _eos
_go i 'll ask mrs . thou when she 's available to show the apartment and let you know . has your number changed ? _eos
_go yeah . dig my new pants ? _eos
_go copycat ! _eos
_go what do you mean ? _eos
_go you went out and bought khakis , too ! _eos
_go no . mine are a soft brown . yours are khaki . _eos
_go whatever . _eos
_go no , what ? _eos
_go he 's got a promotion . _eos
_go you 're kidding . _eos
_go no , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells . _eos
_go i do n't believe it . he is only being with the company for two years . _eos
_go well , it 's true . the board man last thirdly and they choice paul . _eos
_go well . good for him . _eos
_go i think the supermarket is closed now . _eos
_go oh , when does it close ? _eos
_go it closes at 7:00 on sundays . _eos
_go that 's too bad . _eos
_go do n't worry , we can go tomorrow morning . it opens at 8 : 00 . _eos
_go alright . what do you want to do now ? _eos
_go let 's take a walk for a half an hour . my sister will get here at about 8 : 30pm and then we can all go out to dinner . _eos
_go where does she live ? _eos
_go she lives in san francisco . _eos
_go how long has she lived there ? _eos
_go i think she 's lived there for about 10 years . _eos
_go that 's a long time . where did she live before that ? _eos
_go san diego . _eos
_go no . how about you ? _eos
_go not yet . let 's go to that restaurant on the corner . _eos
_go search me . _eos
_go what did you argue about ? _eos
_go he borrowed some money from me and i needed it back . he said he did n't have the money yet . _eos
_go well , he should pay you back . it 's only fair . _eos
_go yes , but i got angry with him too quickly . he probably thought that i mistrusted him . i should n't have got angry . _eos
_go did you lend him a lot of money ? _eos
_go not much . i had to pay an unexpected bill , so i needed the money back . _eos
_go well , talk to him about it next time you see him . he probably feels as bad about it as you do . close friends sometimes have disagreements . it 's nothing unusual . neither of you said anything really nasty , did you ? _eos
_go no , we did n't . i guess you 're right . we should patch things up . _eos
_go of course you should . you would n't want a silly argument to ruin a long friendship , would you ? _eos
_go i do n't think so . i think the government should do everything it can to discourage people from smoking . _eos
_go maybe so . but a law banning cigarettes will do no good . _eos
_go no , you ca n't suddenly make smoking illegal , but government could prohibit smoking in public places like movies and theatres . _eos
_go yes . dolphins have a big brain and they are very smart . they are also the fastest swimmers in the world . _eos
_go they must be amazing animals . _eos
_go they are . i read a story about a dolphin saving a a from drowning in the sea . _eos
_go i read that story too . they seem to be able to understand men . _eos
_go they sure can . maybe they can interact with men better than monkeys and apes . _eos
_go i am not surprised , you eat too much . _eos
_go and i suppose sitting at the desk all day in the office does n't help . _eos
_go no , i would n't think so . _eos
_go i do wish i could lose weight . _eos
_go well , why do n't you go on the diet ? _eos
_go i 've tried diets before but they 've never worked . _eos
_go perhaps you should excercise more . why do n't you go to an exercise class . _eos
_go yes , maybe i should . _eos
_go all right . _eos
_go here is your ticket . _eos
_go thank you . _eos
_go the park will close soon . we should better go in right now . _eos
_go really ? _eos
_go yes , let 's go in . _eos
_go it is a new park , is n't it ? _eos
_go yes , how do you know ? _eos
_go i guessed it . _eos
_go well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history , a window on the world civilization and a window on the world 's tourist attractions as well . _eos
_go oh , how wonderful ! _eos
_go i love dogs . they have been used as guards for centuries . nowadays , they are often used to find illegal drugs and bombs by the police and customs officers . _eos
_go the documentary also pointed out that they are used by shepherds to round up sheep and by rescue workers to find people trapped under rubble or snow . _eos
_go horses are useful to people too . we use them for sports and recreation . _eos
_go do n't forget that horses are still used in many countries to pull ploughs and carts . _eos
_go can you ride a horse ? _eos
_go yes , i can . i do n't ride regularly though . how about you ? _eos
_go i can ride too . perhaps we could go horse riding together at the weekend ? _eos
_go what a good idea ! _eos
_go just call her lisa , mary . she 's cooking dinner . _eos
_go i see . can i sit down ? _eos
_go of course ! make yourself at home . _eos
_go thank you , mr . johnson . _eos
_go please , just call me tom . _eos
_go okay , tom . _eos
_go where 's cindy ? _eos
_go she 's upstairs in my room . _eos
_go can you tell her to come downstairs ? we 're about to have dinner . _eos
_go no , what ? _eos
_go he 's got a promotion . _eos
_go you 're kidding . _eos
_go no , they made him vicepresident in charge of sells . _eos
_go oh , i do n't believe it . he is only being with the company for two years . _eos
_go well , it 's true . the board man last thirdly and they choice paul . _eos
_go well . good for him . _eos
_go if we hurry , can we get there in time ? _eos
_go i hope so . _eos
_go yes , and it 's great . what are the events at the sports meeting ? _eos
_go long - distance race , dash , hurdle race , relay race , standing long jump , high jump , shotput and so on . _eos
_go our neighbor , bruce , will take part in the relay race . let 's go have a look . _eos
_go ok , let 's go . _eos
_go the competition will begin in 5 minutes , it 's tense here . _eos
_go wonderful , bruce is taking the lead . _eos
_go other competitors have almost caught up with him . they are neck and neck . _eos
_go come on , bruce . come on , bruce . _eos
_go wow , bruce crossed the line first . _eos
_go yes , they are shy and gentle but very powerful . _eos
_go you are right . they sweep nancy off her feet . and now she fell head over heels in love with him . _eos
_go how wonderful it would be if i had such smiles ! _eos
_go yes , it 's been marvelous . it really was very kind of you to invite me . i hope it has n't been too much trouble . _eos
_go not at all . we 've really enjoyed having you . i hope you 'll come and stay again next time you 're in changsha . _eos
_go it 's a man - made wonder . i 've seen it many times in textbooks and it 's part of my dream to visit it . _eos
_go someone claimed it was one of the two man - made wonders that could be seen on the moon . _eos
_go that 's true . _eos
_go do you already know how to play an instrument ? _eos
_go uh ... yeah ! i 've told you a thousand times that i 'm learning to play the drums . now that i know how to play well , i would like to form a rock band . _eos
_go aside from yourself , who are the other members of the band ? _eos
_go we have a guy who plays guitar , and another who plays bass . although we still have n't found anyone to be our singer . you told me that you had some musical talent , right ? _eos
_go yes , i 'm a singer . _eos
_go perfect . so you can audition this weekend here at my house . _eos
_go great ! wait here ? you do n't have enough room for the amplifiers , microphones or even your drums ! by the way where do you keep them or practice ? _eos
_go i would like to have that new style gl joe . _eos
_go have you asked santa ? _eos
_go yes and i 've written him a letter . _eos
_go george , how can we ? vacations cost money . and this month we do n't have much money left after paying the rent . _eos
_go well , lili , we can visit different places in the state in our van 10 . we are not going to take a plane or stay at a hotel this time . trust me , it wo n't cost much . _eos
_go where will we sleep , then ? _eos
_go in the van . _eos
_go what about other expenses ? _eos
_go let 's see . gas , food , recreation , we wo n't spend much . come on . do n't hesitate . we need to get out of the house once in a while . we have been working hard , have n't we ? _eos
_go maybe you 're right . when do you plan to go ? _eos
_go the sooner the better ! i ca n't wait ! _eos
_go oh , i do n't know where we 're going yet . _eos
_go as long as we 're going , you can decide where to go . i trust your judgments . i know you miss chinese food , so we can eat at a chinese restaurant this time . _eos
_go let 's go to chicago . we can have lunch in chinatown . then we can go to a ball game at wrigley field ! _eos
_go you have such good ideas ! _eos
_go the science field trip is next monday at 8 o'clock in the morning . do you want to make note of that on your calendar ? _eos
_go yes , i will make note of that . _eos
_go next monday is december 2nd . the buses will leave at 8 , but we must begin loading at 7 _eos
_go i will be there half an hour early . _eos
_go you might want to tell whoever is picking you up that you will return on december 8th . do you have a ride ? _eos
_go yes , someone is picking me up . _eos
_go to get back to campus by 8 _eos
_go not at the moment -- maybe later , though . _eos
_go all of the extra information that you need is on the bulletin board in the hallway . see you on monday ! _eos
_go i 'm sorry for hero . _eos
_go i do n't think there 's any excuse for his acting in some parts . _eos
_go do n't be too critical . we ca n't expect it to be perfect . _eos
_go great - they wined and dined us all week . _eos
_go my boss sent me here to take some business documents back to his office . i did n't know you were working here . what a surprise . how long have you been doing this ? _eos
_go two years or so . _eos
_go that is great . do you have to work the night shift ? _eos
_go no , in most cases i do n't have to unless there is something urgent to deal with . i work five days a week . _eos
_go do you enjoy work here ? _eos
_go it is hard to say . but i 've to start by working as a trainee before i really become an experienced marketing assistant . sometimes , i am really under great pressure when it gets busy . _eos
_go take it easy . i 'm sure you will gain enough experience while working as a marketing assistant . i hope you have n't been given much trouble in the job . _eos
_go luckily not . the silent i meet are generally very friendly and have a good boss . _eos
_go glad to hear that . _eos
_go what 's the second solar system ? _eos
_go it 's just a system like ours , with a star and a number of planets going around it . _eos
_go is this good news or bad news ? _eos
_go it 's exciting news ! if we find a second solar system , we might find a second earth ! _eos
_go you mean with people on it ? _eos
_go yes ! is n't that exciting ? _eos
_go sorry , i thought you knew . _eos
_go but you should tell me you were in love with her . _eos
_go did n't i ? _eos
_go you know you did n't . _eos
_go well , i am telling you now . _eos
_go yes , but you might have told me before . _eos
_go i did n't think you would be interested . _eos
_go you ca n't be serious . how dare you not tell me you are going to marry her ? _eos
_go sorry , i did n't think it mattered . _eos
_go oh , you men ! you are all the same . _eos
_go i did n't really like it . _eos
_go mary said that she was really pleased with the photography . _eos
_go i found it very disappointing . _eos
_go she liked the acting , too , because that 's what she wanted to see . _eos
_go i was n't happy with it . _eos
_go nothing is to your satisfaction . _eos
_go where are you going ? _eos
_go i told you already ! i 'm going to get my nails done . _eos
_go again ? you just went last week ! you spend more time at the nail salon than you do here at home ! honestly , why do you need a manicure every week ? _eos
_go well , first of all , i like to pamper myself , and my nails look great . you should come with me ! _eos
_go why ? i do n't want to have nail polish or anything like that ! _eos
_go they do n't only paint my nails ! the manicurist will remove my cuticles , file my nails , and apply at least nails coats of nail polish ! _eos
_go yeah , sounds like something i should definitely do . _eos
_go good afternoon ! sit down , please . how are you ? _eos
_go i 'm very well , thank you . how are you ? _eos
_go very well too , thank you very much . is n't it a lovely day ? _eos
_go yes , it 's beautiful , but it 's also very hot . _eos
_go yes . _eos
_go what 's the weather like in your country ? _eos
_go mm ... it 's quite warm now . _eos
_go where do you live ? _eos
_go in london . where do you live ? _eos
_go here . near this school . _eos
_go so what are you gon na do ? just quit ? _eos
_go that 's exactly what i am going to do ! i 've decided to create my own company ! i 'm going to write up a business plan , get some investors and start working for myself ! _eos
_go have you ever written up a business plan before ? _eos
_go well , no , it ca n't be that hard ! i mean , all you have to do is explain your business , how you are going to do things and that 's it , right ? _eos
_go you could n't be more wrong ! a well written business plan will include an executive summary which highlights the idea of the business in two pages or less . then you need to describe your company with information such as what type of legal structure it has , history , etc . _eos
_go well , that seems easy enough . _eos
_go wait , there 's more ! then you need to introduce and describe your goods or services . what they are and how they are different from competitors ' ? then comes the hard part , a market analysis . you need to investigate and analyze hundreds of variables ! you need to take into consideration socioeconomic factors from gdp per capita to how many children on average the population has ! all this information is useful so that you can move on to your strategy and implementation stage , where you will describe in detail how you will actually execute your idea . _eos
_go geez . is that all ? _eos
_go almost , the most important piece of information for your investors will be the financial analysis . here you will calculate and estimate sales , cash flow and profits . after all , people will want to know when they will begin to see a return on their investment ! _eos
_go umm . i think i 'll just stick to my old job and save myself all the hassle of trying to start up a business ! _eos
_go so i heard . _eos
_go what 's wrong with her ? _eos
_go she went over the edge after her son was killed in an accident . _eos
_go how about a movie ? we have n't done that for a while . _eos
_go a movie ? sure . do you know what 's on right now ? _eos
_go no . why do n't you check out the newspaper ? _eos
_go ok . maybe you should invite your sister along , too . _eos
_go not much , that new reality - tv show , ally mcneal , oooo , dark angel . _eos
_go wait a second . i want to watch ally mcneal . _eos
_go oh , come on . that 's such a girl 's show . _eos
_go no it 's not . it 's just funny . _eos
_go yeah , if you 're a girl . _eos
_go well , you just want to watch dark angel because of the hot girl . _eos
_go that 's not true . dark angel is a good show . _eos
_go it 's story is just an excuse to get the girl dressed up in different tight outfits . _eos
_go o . k . , o . k . let 's forget it . there 's a football game on too . _eos
_go no way . i 'm watching ally mcneal . go to john 's to watch the game . _eos
_go what are you talking about ? _eos
_go do n't you see many parents are forcing there children 's hands to learn something they think important to their children . but the children are not interested in it at all . _eos
_go you said it . many parents just do n't know how to educate their children . _eos
_go i went shopping . _eos
_go did you buy anything ? _eos
_go yes , i bought a few things . _eos
_go what did you buy ? _eos
_go i bought this coat . do you like it ? _eos
_go yeah , i like it a lot . it 's very pretty . where did you buy it ? _eos
_go at the mall on 5th street . _eos
_go was it expensive ? _eos
_go no , it was n't expensive . it was on sale for 20 dollars . _eos
_go that 's cheap . _eos
_go i know . it was a really good deal . _eos
_go i do n't think you 'll need to wear it for a while . it 's been really hot lately . _eos
_go oh , i 'm fine . _eos
_go so , are you going to go to class tonight ? _eos
_go maybe ... but i do n't think so . _eos
_go really ? what 's the matter ? _eos
_go i do n't know . i 'm just feeling a little sad . _eos
_go listen . come with me to class , and after class we can go out for dinner . _eos
_go now that 's a good idea . thanks a lot , brian . i 'm feeling better already . _eos
_go he can barely make ends meet . _eos
_go they 're absolutely right to get a replacement for 21 . _eos
_go if the phoenix beats the rocket , it will enter the final . _eos
_go no way , if it still has 21 . _eos
_go it 's the best seller everyone 's been talking about for the last six months . _eos
_go how in the world did you get a copy ? i 've put a hold on it at the public library for weeks and i 'm still waiting my turn . _eos
_go i checked it out of the rental library . it only costs five cents a day . _eos
_go is it really worth paying for ? _eos
_go i ca n't tell yet . i have n't got beyond the first chapter . _eos
_go if it 's any good , i 'll buy a copy when it comes out in the pocket edition . _eos
_go wow , i ca n't catch my breath . you are running too fast , honey . _eos
_go you just need more exercise . _eos
_go yes , but you need to slow down . this is jogging , not racing ! _eos
_go i do n't care . i want to burn up my fat . _eos
_go but running so fast is not good for people over forties . _eos
_go why ? _eos
_go we are not as athletic as we were when young . mild exercise is more suitable for us . _eos
_go but i want to burn up more calories ! _eos
_go in fact , in order to burn up your fat , you must take it slowly for a longer time . _eos
_go really ? i will slow down then . _eos
_go fine , thank you . i have n't seen you for quite some time . what have you been up to recently ? _eos
_go i have been spending a lot of time watching movies at home , so you would n't have seen me . recently , i 've been obsessed with horror films . _eos
_go oh , how can you be infatuated with horror films ? they 're so scary . _eos
_go yeah , you are right i used to not watch horror films , but after seeing silence of the lamb with mike last month , i fell in love with them . _eos
_go it 's amazing . but if i were you , i would n't have the courage to watch the first one . _eos
_go but it 's really exciting . _eos
_go maybe , but i would rather watch romance , science fiction , crime or even disaster movie instead of a horror picture . i would n't dare sleep at night after watching one . _eos
_go basically . you 'll watch any type of movie except horror . _eos
_go yep . _eos
_go i think you should have a try someday . maybe you 'll change your mind . _eos
_go maybe . after all , i am grown up now . _eos
_go the economy has been stagnant for a while now . we 've been in a recessive state for several months already . what worries me the most is the trade deficit . i think the government should do more to encourage exports . _eos
_go increasing exports would weaken the currency . i think the main point is economic growth . we need more jobs . factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries . the result is an increase in unemployment in our own country , lower consumption , lower production , and an overall feeble economy . if more people are working , it will give the economy a boost . _eos
_go it 's true that we should do something about unemployment , but what about inflation ? if unemployment falls , there 's pressure to increase pay . that would result in inflation , which would result in a much less dynamic economy . _eos
_go not really . i like going to an art exhibition once or twice a year . i hardly know anything about art or sculpture . you are a true art lover , are n't you ? _eos
_go i love going to art galleries , particularly when one is holding an exhibition of abstract art . _eos
_go i never understand the meaning of those painting . they are too abstract for me . i did n't pay much attention in art class at school . _eos
_go art is n't for everyone . i 'm going to an exhibition tomorrow at the national gallery . it 's an exhibition of greek and roman sculpture . _eos
_go i like sculpture , especially that from ancient rome or greece . what time are you thinking of going ? i 'd love to go with you . _eos
_go i thought i 'd have an early lunch and go immediately afterwards . does that sound ok to you ? bus 51 goes directly there . _eos
_go that sounds fine . what time shall we meet at the bus stop ? _eos
_go let 's meet at 12 thirty . it will probably take us three or four hours to see all of the exhibits . _eos
_go my mother works in a company as an accountant . _eos
_go is she busy ? _eos
_go not always , she 's rather busy at the end of the year . _eos
_go hello , jack . happy birthday ! _eos
_go my birthday ? i forgot it , thank you for remembering my birthday . _eos
_go i 'd like to offer you my congratulations on your birthday and best wishes for your future happiness , good health and continued success . i 've asked the fairy flowers to send you a bunch of flowers . i hope you 'll like them . _eos
_go thanks a lot . i 'm so touched . _eos
_go now let me sing " happy birthday " for you . _eos
_go thank you very much . _eos
_go it sure is . _eos
_go it 's a good day for a picnic . _eos
_go i do n't want to . _eos
_go well , come over and talk to me then . _eos
_go certainly not . _eos
_go may i turn on the tv then ? _eos
_go turn on the tv for what ? _eos
_go so that we can sit down together and listen to some music . _eos
_go listen to the music ? and who will cook dinner , will you ? _eos
_go i will , but let 's go to the disco after dinner . _eos
_go to a disco ? oh , no . you know i hate it . _eos
_go brian ! how have you been ? _eos
_go pretty good . say , you 've really changed ! _eos
_go oh , well , i 've lost some weight . and my hair is longer than before . _eos
_go well , you look great ! how are you ? _eos
_go i 'm doing really well . i got married about three years ago . i have two kids now . _eos
_go that 's terrific ! _eos
_go it 's very nice . there are only four people , and those girls are very kind and friendly . _eos
_go well , do you all major in the same subject ? _eos
_go no , the other three girls major in a computer science , and they can help me a lot with the computer operating . _eos
_go that 's great ! _eos
_go well , i swim and run every day . _eos
_go now , tell me , what do you eat ? _eos
_go well , i do n't eat any meat , but i do eat fish and eggs . _eos
_go do you eat a lot of vegetables ? _eos
_go oh yes , and fruit , i love fruit . _eos
_go what do you drink ? _eos
_go well , i never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . they are very bad for you . _eos
_go we are going to climb a cliff on the colorado river . _eos
_go how hard is the climb ? _eos
_go it is a very difficult climb because there are not many places to put your hands and feet . _eos
_go what did you do last week ? _eos
_go we rappelled down the side of 300 - foot cliff . it was very exciting . _eos
_go wow ! that sounds like a lot of fun . i 'm sorry i missed it . _eos
_go well , you should come this weekend . i think you could do the climb . _eos
_go yeah , i will . see you then ! _eos
_go o . k . see you . _eos
_go i can speak french and german . _eos
_go how well can you speak them ? _eos
_go i can speak german quite well , but i ca n't speak french very well . _eos
_go can you help me to translate these sentences into german now ? _eos
_go no , but i 'll be able to tomorrow . _eos
_go chill ! i 'm just curling my eyelashes . _eos
_go it looks like some kind of primitive form of torture . _eos
_go you 're such a wimp ! you 're afraid of an eyelash curler . _eos
_go well , you might pinch your eyelid ! or lose an eyeball ! _eos
_go it just makes my eyelashes curl upwards . _eos
_go yes . i 'm afraid so . _eos
_go but you 'll miss out on the football game . _eos
_go oh . well , it ca n't be helped . _eos
_go oh , do you really think so ? _eos
_go of course , otherwise you 'll just have to wait for hours . _eos
_go but i just got a call from my sister and i have to cancel the movie tonight . _eos
_go that 's terrible ! _eos
_go you see ? every cloud has a silver lining . _eos
_go come on ! you 're pulling my leg . _eos
_go really ! here 's my trophy . _eos
_go wow ! congratulations ! _eos
_go thank you . _eos
_go is that your wedding ring ? _eos
_go i 'm not married yet . it 's my engagement ring . _eos
_go well , congratulations . when is the big date ? _eos
_go in june . _eos
_go did you have the watch before getting the ring ? _eos
_go actually , we bought the ring together after i got the watch . _eos
_go you did a fabulous job with the selection . it 's gorgeous . _eos
_go thank you so much . _eos
_go what kind of watch is it ? _eos
_go it 's a tag heer . _eos
_go if you do n't mind me asking , how much do they cost ? _eos
_go this one is $ 1500 . but they range from $ 600 to $ 3000 . _eos
_go that 's why it looks so nice . i should have figured . you always get what you pay for . _eos
_go yeah . i would rather get one nice watch instead of 20 mediocre ones . _eos
_go what for ? ( why ? ) _eos
_go not very well . _eos
_go why ? looks like you 're feeling very down ! what happened ? _eos
_go nothing . _eos
_go come on . for a man who 's feeling so , down , there 're usually two reasons . either his career is going downhill , or he has a broken heart . since you 're so successful , it must be the latter . _eos
_go well , you 're right . i just broke up with jane . _eos
_go oh , i 'm sorry . i thought you two were made for each ocher . _eos
_go well , you never know . i 'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down , but she says she wants to pursue her career while she 's still young . _eos
_go well , she is not to blame . it 's always difficult to choose between career and family . _eos
_go maybe you 're right . _eos
_go jack , i do n't know what to say to comfort you , but cheer up ! there are plenty of fish in the sea and you 'll find your soul mate , your perfect match ! _eos
_go yeah , but it 's hard to forget her at moment . you know , we were together for almost five years . it 's really hard ... _eos
_go sally . she is a bachelor girl . she is an excellent designer . many of the company 's advertisements are her child trains . _eos
_go why is she still single ? she must have a face that would stop clock . _eos
_go oh , quite the other way round . she is a knock - out . she devotes much of her time to her career . _eos
_go my watch is a few minutes fast . it 's about six forty , i think . _eos
_go is it ? oh , no . the concert will begin in twenty minutes . are we too late to get there ? _eos
_go if we start now , we can make it by taxi . _eos
_go yeah . _eos
_go who won ? _eos
_go china . _eos
_go what is the score ? _eos
_go china beat brazil three to zero . _eos
_go wonderful . _eos
_go the boss wanted to pay bob with stock options . but bob did n't want to play that game again . _eos
_go again ? _eos
_go at his last start - up , bob worked for stock and no salary . they folded and he made zip . _eos
_go ouch . _eos
_go now he only works freelance . hundred bucks an hour . _eos
_go i 'm sorry . i wo n't do it again . _eos
_go try to be more careful in future . look ! you 've damaged the sign . _eos
_go is this the sign ? what does it says ? _eos
_go it says no smoking here . _eos
_go sure . take a seat ... what would you like to know ? _eos
_go first , i 've heard that your latest book is based on a true story . _eos
_go that 's correct . it 's a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in florida several years ago . the main character - the police invesigator - is based on the man who investigated the case . _eos
_go how do you research your books ? _eos
_go i always visit the places that i use as setting for stories . readers like things to be as factually correct as possible - even in fiction ! i usually base my characters on people i have met . most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people . _eos
_go i really like your books . i 've just finished this one . i read it from cover to cover in a single day . congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again ! _eos
_go thank you . let met sign it for you ... there you go . _eos
_go oh ! thank you very much . i heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories . what are the stories about ? _eos
_go there 's a real mix of stories in the book . i have n't finished all of them yet , though . many of them are short detective stories , but there are also horror stories and sci - fi ones . if you give me your business card , i 'll make sure you get an advance copy to review . _eos
_go thanks very much . i 'm sure it will sell well . i ca n't wait to read it . here 's my card . thank you for you time . _eos
_go oh , you may call him uncle , or henry . _eos
_go what 's he doing ? _eos
_go he 's checking bags . he 's an official in the customs . _eos
_go that 's a wonderful way to celebrate this grand old library ! _eos
_go i hoped you would be willing to brainstorm with me for party ideas . _eos
_go that is right up my alley . you say party and i 'm there . _eos
_go perfect . it will be open to the public and we anticipate roughly about five to seven hundred people . _eos
_go will it be an all day event ? _eos
_go yes . and we checked with the city and we have permission to use the park adjacent to the library . _eos
_go that was quick thinking . _eos
_go cool ! flashy red lines ! _eos
_go i think this is the coolest watch i 've ever owned . _eos
_go is it waterproof ? _eos
_go is n't that a silly question ? you know how much of an athlete i am . _eos
_go uh , huh ... so what kind of sports do you need a waterproof watch for ? _eos
_go well , surfing , scuba diving ... _eos
_go yeah , everyday . and there 's only one choice . all the other buses are going the other direction . _eos
_go hmm . i have the same problem . when i leave work , it 's always rush hour . so the buses are always crowded . _eos
_go oh , yeah , it 's terrible . i will tell you the funniest thing i have seen in china . it 's when so many people try to get onto one city bus , and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt . _eos
_go that sounds terrible the way you describe it . but you know , not long ago i really suffered on the bus . _eos
_go what happened ? were you having a hard time getting on a bus ? _eos
_go you just ca n't imagine ! i waited for the first bus but it was too full , so i waited for the second , and it was still very crowded . then i decided not to wait for the next one , and got on the second bus . it was so full that i had to stand on one foot ! no kidding ! _eos
_go hmm . good exercise , uh ? _eos
_go yeah , absolutely ! _eos
_go and it 's so much fun . one day , the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl 's behind was pressed against my front . i was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her . _eos
_go you were so happy , were n't you ? _eos
_go what do you think ? i 'm a good boy . _eos
_go that 's great . _eos
_go now let 's get things ready . _eos
_go do n't worry . there are all kinds of things in the center . _eos
_go that 's much more convenient . we do n't even have to bring the flavorings . _eos
_go yeah , they all received very strict training . a minute on the stage takes ten - year practice . _eos
_go and all their movements are so elegant . it seems like dancing in the water . _eos
_go exactly , you know , water ballet puts dancing , music and swimming together . _eos
_go there you go ! daddy has told me that water ballet is also called synchronized swimming . _eos
_go that 's my boy ! katherine curtis created this activity in 1920 . and in 1984 , it was authorized as one activity in olympic games . _eos
_go wow , mom is more knowledgeable than dad . i must learn from you . _eos
_go my little boy , you should learn more from me . i 'm almost thirty years older than you . _eos
_go ok , you 're the boss . look , mom , one guy has just jumped into the swimming pool . _eos
_go oh , my god . it 's so dangerous . and he might break his leg . you must n't do anything like that . _eos
_go the boy is good for nothing . _eos
_go as a teacher , i do n't know how to help him . _eos
_go he is hopeless . _eos
_go not bad . we have had a big meeting today , remember ? _eos
_go oh , yea . i forgot . so how did it go ? _eos
_go pretty well . i think the boss liked my ideas . _eos
_go great , so what happens now ? _eos
_go well , i have to write the proposal . i 'm pretty excited about it . _eos
_go of course , they are out there . _eos
_go but i never saw them . _eos
_go are you stupid ? they are called ufos , so not everybody can see them . _eos
_go you mean that you can them . _eos
_go that 's right . i can see them in my dreams . _eos
_go they come to the earth ? _eos
_go no . their task is to send the aliens here from the outer space . _eos
_go aliens from the outer space ? do you talk to them ? what do they look like ? _eos
_go ok , ok , one by one , please ! they look like robots , but they can speak . their mission is to make friends with human beings . _eos
_go that means that you talk to them ? in which language ? _eos
_go of course in english , they learn english on mars too . _eos
_go wow . sounds fantastic ! _eos
_go yes . i 've won the first prize in the math contest . _eos
_go really ? congratulations ! _eos
_go thank you , paul . _eos
_go by the way , would you like to have dinner with me tomorrow evening ? tomorrow is my birthday . _eos
_go good , happy birthday to you ! _eos

_go sure . what 's up ? _eos
_go yes , that 's right . that 's the poster of the the witch . _eos
_go may , i really regret watching it with you last night . _eos
_go did it scare you ? _eos
_go of course not . i just thought the movie was ... boring . _eos
_go boring ? come on , you clutched to my arm all the time . _eos
_go well , i admit . the ghosts were scary . _eos
_go i like scary movies . _eos
_go that 's gucci 's influence . i love science fiction movies ! _eos
_go of course you do . they are silly stories just for little kids like you . _eos
_go do n't call me kid . i am a grownup . _eos
_go do you dare watch scary movies with me tonight ? _eos
_go of course ! i can watch them without you ! _eos
_go oh , really ? _eos

_go there are a few stories about natural disasters . there is a massive forest fire in australia . it covers several square kilometers of land has destroyed many more square kilometers . _eos
_go was it caused accidentally or naturally ? sometimes it gets so hot that fires begin naturally in australia and africa . _eos

_go does the newspaper say anything about casualties ? _eos
_go so far , less than 20 people have died , but over 100 are in hospital . _eos
_go yes , it is . it was taken just before i was leaving for college . _eos
_go you look so lovely . _eos
_go how time flies ! i 'll not see twenty again . _eos

_go it 's the truth . _eos
_go are you okay ? _eos
_go i really wanted to get into nyu . _eos
_go i am really sorry to hear that . _eos
_go it 's okay . i 'm still waiting to hear from ucla anyway . _eos
_go my girlfriend just broke up with me . _eos
_go you must feel terrible now . _eos
_go yeah . _eos
_go i remember my first break up . it was the worst feeling in the world . i was crying everyday for three months . and slowly , it got better . i know you 'll feel better too . _eos
_go you 've been through this too ? _eos
_go yeah . i remember it very clearly . the pain makes it easy to remember . i know you 're really hurting right now , but you know many people experience break ups . _eos
_go but it hurts too much . _eos
_go i know it 's painful , but it 's only temporary . after the pain goes away , you 'll find other girls . _eos
_go what if i do n't want to find another girl ? _eos
_go you 'll change your mind . look at everyone in the world . they all break up and move on . the faster you understand this , the quicker you will recover . _eos
_go you 're right . _eos
_go i also know you must still have strong feelings for her , but try to think of all the bad things . you know she did n't treat you that well . is that the person you want to spend the rest of your life with ? _eos
_go yeah . thanks for the talk . _eos
_go i 'll give you a call later . we should hang out . it 's good to be around people . _eos
_go ok . i 'll talk to you later . _eos
_go let me see . the one goes for $ 17 . _eos
_go would you take $ 12 ? _eos
_go no , i ca n't let you have it for 12 . how about 14 ? _eos
_go 13 . 50 ? _eos
_go sorry , $ 14 is the lowest i can go . _eos
_go never mind about that . _eos
_go i 'm terribly sorry , wo n't you let me pay for ? _eos
_go no , i wo n't hear of it . _eos
_go nice to see you again , too . peter . how 's your family ? _eos
_go a : : very well . how 's mrs clinton ? _eos
_go not bad , but she 's as busy as before . _eos
_go you are right . we should n't do anything under the table . _eos
_go well , since you agree with me , we should put the issue above board instead of talking about through other channels . _eos
_go hi , vince . thanks for stopping by . how 's the work coming along for the online auction ? _eos
_go oh , yeah . i 'm glad you mentioned that . i think we need to hire somebody new to manage it . _eos
_go ca n't elvin handle it ? _eos
_go i think he 's got too much on his plate . _eos
_go how about the soup ? _eos
_go i 've never tasted anything better . _eos
_go how nice of you to say so . _eos
_go not much , just heading over to the shooting range . you wanna come ? _eos
_go seriously ? you mean to fire a real weapon ? i do n't know man . _eos
_go yeah , it will be fun ! i have a 9 mm pistol that is really easy to shoot . i also have a revolver that 's really fun too ! they have big targets at the range that we could use to practice and improve your aim . _eos
_go yeah that would be cool ! maybe i can also have a try at other weapons like a machine gun or a shotgun ! maybe even a rocket launcher or an anti tank missile ! or what about a flame thrower ! _eos
_go whoa , take it easy there rambo . do n't get carried away . these weapons are not toys , and you must first learn how to handle them properly . there are basic rules that you must abide by in order to be safe . for example , never handle a weapon that you have n't inspected yourself . always make sure there is n't anything in the chamber , and never put your finger on the trigger unless you are ready to shoot ! _eos
_go wow , i did n't know ! it always looks so cool and easy in the movies ! _eos
_go the reality is different you know , running and firing a weapon is a lot harder than in the movies ! so are you ready ? _eos
_go let 's do it ! _eos
_go i 'm fine . i 've been out of town . i just got back . _eos
_go where were you ? _eos
_go i was in new york for a wedding . _eos
_go do n't feel like it . i 'm broke . _eos
_go well , we can still do some window shopping , ca n't we ? _eos
_go just look around ? ah , that 's boring . _eos
_go i 'll go myself then . _eos
_go i do n't know . my life is a big mess . everything is so complicated . _eos
_go come on , nothing can be that bad . _eos
_go but promise me , you 'll keep it a secret . _eos
_go ok , i promise . so what 's troubling you so much ? _eos
_go i 've fallen in love with my boss . _eos
_go really ? is he married ? _eos
_go no , of course not . he is still single . _eos
_go then what 's your problem ? _eos
_go i try to keep it to myself . but there is a lot of gossip about us . _eos
_go oh , i see . office romance tends to be the subject of gossip . _eos
_go worse still , he is trying to avoid me these days . _eos
_go office romance is very tricky . _eos
_go it gives me a lot of pressure and i feel depressed . _eos
_go cheer up , nada . you 'll be fine . _eos
_go oh , nothing special . i 'm just a bit tired . _eos
_go with the job ? _eos
_go with everything , with everybody , with all this ! _eos
_go a good suggestion for you . you need a holiday . _eos
_go it was n't always like this , you know . _eos
_go what do you mean ? _eos
_go well , i mean . we always do the same thing . there 's no variety in our lives . _eos
_go you need a holiday . that 's what 's the matter . _eos
_go certainly , perhaps . _eos
_go hey , isabelle ... _eos
_go logan ! why on earth are you hiding here ? white hat ! come on ! do n't tell me you 're the guy ! it ca n't be true . _eos
_go yes , i am the guy . _eos
_go what a bummer ! you set me up ? _eos
_go let me explain . i did n't mean to hurt you ... _eos
_go how dare you ! ( starts to walk off ) _eos
_go hang on one second . hear me out , just this once , isabella ! _eos
_go why did you lie to me in the email ? _eos
_go i did n't lie . you just did n't ask me my real name . _eos
_go i should have known it was you . no wonder all the 20 questions were answered correctly . i thought i might have found the one for me . _eos
_go i 'm sorry . it was cruel of me . but i promise it will never happen again ? look , there 's a nice restaurant . let me take you to dinner and we can talk things over . _eos
_go well , i swim and run every day . _eos
_go now , tell me , what do you eat ? _eos
_go well , i do n't eat any meat , but i do eat fish and eggs . _eos
_go do you eat a lot of vegetables ? _eos
_go oh yes , and fruit , i love fruit . _eos
_go what do you drink ? _eos
_go well , i never drink alcohol , coffee or tea . they are very bad for you . _eos
_go what do you drink ? _eos
_go yeah . _eos
_go who won ? _eos
_go china . _eos
_go what was the score ? _eos
_go china beat brazil 3 to 0 . _eos
_go wonderful ! _eos
_go i would n't be so sure ... people want to wear what they feel most comfortable in . _eos
_go maybe that 's true for some positions , but i think the marketing and sales staff would definitely not agree . they dress for success ! you ca n't go out on a sales call if you are dressed in jeans . it 's just not respectful to you client . _eos
_go i think what you wear is so overrated . i would rather have a down - to - earth , honest and solid sales person than a painted , patent leather , designer suite salesman . _eos
_go it 's not as simple as that . people judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . so dressing professional is being professional . the image that you portray to others is so important in business . it 's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale . _eos
_go maybe you 're right , but i 'll take my sneakers and jeans any day ! _eos
_go what do you mean ? _eos
_go i mean look at all these magnificent buildings around us . _eos
_go yes , look over there . that 's the empire state building . my book says it 's 102 stories tall . _eos
_go it 's quite famous but do n't you think it looks a bit old - fashioned ? _eos
_go you 're right , but when it was built in 1930 it was a marvel of technology and engineering . _eos
_go what other important buildings are we going to see on fifth avenue ? _eos
_go quite a number . actually every skyscraper has a history . a few blocks ahead we 'll see st . patrick 's cathedral and just across the street will be the world - renowed rockefeller center . it 's a landmark in the history of architecture . _eos
_go what 's there after that ? _eos
_go well then , there 's a central park . facing the park on fifth avenue is probably some of the most expensive properties in the world . _eos
_go what are they all for ? _eos
_go most of them are office buildings , huge department stores , and hotels but some are just private homes . new york is one of the financial centers of the world . and there are lots of very expensive places . _eos
_go i needed to get out of the house . my parents just went ballistic over something my older sister told them . _eos
_go what did she tell them ? is she dropping out of college ? _eos
_go nothing that serious . she finally told them that she moved out of the dormitory a few months ago and has been living with her boyfriend . _eos
_go and your parents took it badly ? _eos
_go that 's putting it mildly . my father started shouting at my sister and my mother just glared at her . _eos
_go ouch , that sounds bad . what did your sister do ? _eos
_go she started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they 're in love and it 's not hurting anybody , and so on . my dad said she 's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away . _eos
_go how long has your sister been with her boyfriend ? _eos
_go three years . they 've been dating since freshman year . they 're even talking about marriage . _eos
_go really ? then i guess living together would be a good idea . _eos
_go what do you mean ? _eos
_go well , these days too many people are getting divorced . if they live together , then at least they 're finding out if they 're really compatible or not . _eos
_go i guess so . better to find out now than after you 're married , when it 's harder to get out . _eos
_go yeah , you can count on it . _eos
_go i think so . yes , they get along so well . _eos
_go i like him . he 's good for her . _eos
_go you 're right . he sure is . _eos
_go he is all right . but i think he seems to have no back bone . _eos
_go why do you say that ? _eos
_go whatever things get tough , he gives in . _eos
_go do n't worry . we 'll make it back to the camp site before dark . _eos
_go i sure hope so . _eos
_go oh , we never speak spanish in class ! miss . parker speaks to us only in english . _eos
_go i suppose she 's right . does she speak english very slowly ? _eos
_go not always . sometimes we do n't understand her . then she has to repeat what she said . _eos
_go it must be interesting to study english . _eos
_go mario and i are the best students in the class . miss . parker says that my pronunciation is very good . _eos
_go is english pronunciation easy or difficult ? _eos
_go sometimes it 's difficult . some words look different from the way one pronounces them . _eos
_go yes . i like winter . _eos
_go me too . _eos
_go it 's snowing heavily . what about taking a walk ? _eos
_go that 's a good idea . let 's go ! _eos
_go what a heavy snow ! look ! the water is frozen . _eos
_go take care ! do n't slip on the ground . _eos
_go i 've got it . i like the feeling of stepping on the ice . _eos
_go yes . very wonderful . _eos
_go there is a snowman over there . _eos
_go how lovely it is ! _eos
_go just tell him off . _eos
_go kobe bryant and shaquille o'neal , they are the los angeles lakers'star players . _eos
_go oh . _eos
_go wait a second . he shoots , he scores ! _eos
_go all right ! _eos
_go here comes jordan , though . _eos
_go wow , michael jordan 's slam - dunks are beautiful things to watch . _eos
_go yeah . he 's older , so he does n't slam as much as he did when he was younger , but when he does , it 's still amazing . _eos
_go which team do you think will win ? _eos
_go the lakers . jordan is the only good player washington has . _eos
_go it 's ok . what do you want to ask ? _eos
_go where should i go after i arrived at the university ? _eos
_go the first place you should go is the international center . _eos
_go why ? _eos
_go you can get help there in dealing with the united states immigration and naturalization service ; you can find foreign student advisers . _eos
_go what kind of role do foreign student advisers play ? _eos
_go they 'll discuss personal concerns , housing , adjustment , finances and other matters with you . _eos
_go can we get any more help at the international center ? _eos
_go yes , a lot more . if you go there just before the beginning of the fall 's semester , you can get your student i d and social security number there . they will keep your documents up - to - date . they will offer an orientation program for new comers . they will also help you contact your department and registration office . _eos
_go i see . it must be worth going to . _eos
_go besides these , the center staff also works with community organizations which provide tours , home hospitality , speaking engagements and assistance for wives of foreign students . in cooperation with nationality clubs , student associations and other organizations , the international center provides a varied program of cultural and social events throughout the year . _eos
_go wonderful . it is a home for foreign students . _eos
_go it sure is . they also serve tea , coffee and refreshments . the center staff members are also friendly and helpful . everyone loves them . _eos
_go i can hardly make ends meet these days . _eos
_go same here . i have't brought any new clothes for three months . _eos
_go my income remains the same but prices just continue to rise . _eos
_go true . the news says that there is a general increase in the price of daily necessities . _eos
_go definitely . i have to spend 300 yuan more on food every month . _eos
_go the biggest price jump is for pork , so most people have to turn to chicken . _eos
_go is that inflation ? _eos
_go inflation is more than just the rising prices , i guess . but the central bank is warning about the risk of inflation . _eos
_go has the government taken some measures to curb it ? _eos
_go yes . the government has banned price hikes in some key industries like energy . _eos
_go but i 'm afraid the price hikes will spill over from food into other areas of the economy . _eos
_go you said it . i think we should tighten our budget and cut our spending . _eos
_go how ? _eos
_go for a start , we can take the public transport to work . you know , running a car is a big expense . _eos
_go sounds a good idea . _eos
_go you should n't grab someone else 's shirt . that 's a foul . _eos
_go play is stopped when the person with the ball is touched . _eos
_go you can touch them only between the shoulder and the knees . _eos
_go the touchdown lines are there and there . ok , let 's play ! _eos
_go before we start , let 's have a moment of silence for our fallen men . _eos
_go yeah , almost . but there is one thing . _eos
_go what ? _eos
_go i still wonder what privacy meant for chinese people . i do n't mean to say that there 's no privacy in china , but ... _eos
_go what is it ? _eos
_go some of my chinese colleagues just share their personal stories in front of others . _eos
_go that makes you feel uncomfortable ? _eos
_go yeah . we never do that in a public office . _eos
_go perhaps that 's because we hold different ideas about privacy . _eos
_go i have felt that . one day when i was in a queue , reading a newspaper story , the man behind me peered through my shoulder and stared at the newspaper i was holding . _eos
_go well , that 's not rare . i 've seen people reading at others'newspaper while taking a metro or a bus . _eos
_go just stare at the newspaper holding in the hands of the one next to him ? _eos
_go yeah . _eos
_go oh , i 'm shocked . _eos
_go i took a lot of courses , such as philosophy , logic , ethics , aesthetics , etc . _eos
_go which course did you like best ? _eos
_go i liked aesthetics best . it is very impressive . _eos
_go certainly . what 's the matter ? _eos
_go i wonder if you often trade with others on the internet . _eos
_go sure . i often buy things or do business through it without going out to the physical stores . _eos
_go great ! it 's just like viewless stores . but how can you shop or order on line or trade on line ? _eos
_go that 's simple . just click the hyperlink , www . taobao . com or www . ebay . com , and you can see the specimen of the goods shown on the screen , and then you can place an order online with the sales company . and the goods will be delivered to your place . _eos
_go is the service charged ? _eos
_go no . it 's free . _eos
_go really . i 'll get a computer at once . _eos
_go it 's so cool ! _eos
_go i 'm afraid this seat is taken . _eos
_go oh . is it . thank you anyway . _eos
_go you 're welcome . why do n't you ask the conductor when he comes by ? _eos
_go thank you . _eos
_go i feel eggplants are more nutritious . _eos
_go but as a matter of fact , potatoes taste better . _eos
_go oh , that 's how you see it . _eos
_go hmm ... i 'll tell you what . i 'll lend you four thousand dollars , but you have to pay me back next week . _eos
_go it 's a deal . _eos
_go alps , suppose . _eos
_go oh , yes , you like skiing . _eos
_go right . _eos
_go you were showing respect and admiration for them . _eos
_go i wish i were a hero . _eos
_go is he really ? _eos
_go yes , he is . he loves the girl very much . _eos
_go who is he marring ? _eos
_go a girl he met on holiday in spain , i think . _eos
_go have they set a date for the wedding ? _eos
_go not yet . _eos
_go does the class start again , mam ? _eos
_go yes , but to the heath , this break has long enough . _eos
_go oh , breaktime flies . _eos
_go come on , baby . it 's time now . _eos
_go mam , another minute , could i ? _eos
_go hurry up , little boy . _eos
_go yes , i like collecting things . _eos
_go oh , that 's interesting , and but what kind of things ? _eos
_go several things , for example , very coins , stamps , stones and so on . _eos
_go stones ? i know many people collecting coins and stamps but stones ? _eos
_go yes , stones . _eos
_go well , i ca n't just imagine it . _eos
_go mary told me that she had seen you with john last night . i got to know the fact that you are playing the field . _eos
_go honey , cross my heart , i'v never looked at another woman since the first day i set my eyes on you ! believe me , that 's the truth . _eos
_go yes . how about going out and enjoying the sunshine on the grass ? _eos
_go great , let 's go ! _eos
_go hey , darling , i think i might have a little heatstroke from being in the sun all day . i was so relaxed . it felt as if i were in another world . _eos
_go exactly . you know , the sunshine and wind remind me of our honeymoon . you remember ? the island , the sound of the waves , the salty sea air and the sunshine ... _eos
_go yes , it was wonderful but it 's already been a year . how time flies ! _eos
_go why not go again to celebrate out one - year anniversary ? we can go to the same beach , stay in the same hotel and enjoy a dinner in the same restaurant . _eos
_go are you kidding ? can you afford it ? do you think we can get a room on such short notice ? _eos
_go never mind that , i 'll take care of it . are you available next week ? _eos
_go yeah , i think so . _eos
_go ok . i 'll make the arrangements . it will be great . _eos
_go wonderful ! i 'll start packing our suitcases . _eos
